Instructions:
    1. create & activate virtual env
    2. Install the dependencies (requests, bs4, lxml)
    3. Add your scrapper Api key at <API_KEY>
    4. define variables in the script
        ZIP_CODE = '33312'
        TYPE = 'single-family-home,condo'  # choices -> multi-family-home,mfd-mobile-home,farms-ranches,land,condo,townhome,single-family-home,apartments,any
        BEDROOMS = '2'
        BATHROOMS = '2'
        MIN_PRICE = '0'
        MAX_PRICE = '150000'
        CATEGORY = 'buy'  # choices -> buy, rent

    5. Program will create 'rent_properties.csv' or 'buy_properties.csv' based on the input params


Feedback:
1. Property type search option added
2. Hyperlink enabled
3. Script not serach on 'realtor.com' home page. Instead it generate search link based on the input params.
    For 'buy' option it will like to search the properties from 'https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-search/33312/beds-2/baths-2/type-single-family-home,condo/price-0-150000/sby-6/pg-1'
    For 'rent' option it will like to search the properties from 'https://www.realtor.com/apartments/33312/beds-2/baths-2/type-single-family-home,condo/price-0-150000/sby-6/pg-1'
    And it traverse every available pages and also in your terminal or console it will show in which link it currently scrapping. I extract 294 properties for the sample input params.
    And also show when it ignore a property which is already availalbe on csv. You can forcefully close the program or keep it checking.
4. I check the script with the provided sample input params, it only takes the search result.
5. How could i generate zillow link for a property?
