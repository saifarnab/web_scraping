For 1. Thanks for the complement. I really appriciate it.

For 2. All of these movies you mentaioned here fillup with N/A imdb_id beacuse of the calculate_similarity function.
        For example the numbers givee a movie named `star wars: the rise of skyw... 2019` but the imdb site
        enlist this movie as `Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker`. We took those who have above 95% similarity.
        I remove the calculate_similarity function so it will take take the frst suggested movie from imdb.

For 3. Script will skip all the franchises with only one movie

For 4. i undestand your consern to save all the content in a dataframe then put all of them to excel file.
        there are 2 major impact on this. Currently, it saves the extracted data to the excel realtime. so any sort of intruption
        in the script you can still have all the extracted data before intruption.
        And, to save all the data in dataframe can produce load in your computer memory (RAM). Which can be drive to slow down the computer
        and eventually hang the extraction process.
