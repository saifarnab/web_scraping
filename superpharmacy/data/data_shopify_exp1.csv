<p><strong>Consumer Medicine Information</strong></p>
<h2>What is in this leaflet</h2>
<p>This leaflet answers some common questions about BRETARIS GENUAIR.</p>
<p>It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>All medicines have risks and benefits. Your pharmacist or doctor will be able to advise you about the risks and benefits of using BRETARIS GENUAIR.</p>
<p><strong>If you have any concerns about using this medicine, ask your pharmacist or doctor.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keep this leaflet with the medicine.</strong> You may need to read it again.</p>
<h2>What BRETARIS GENUAIR is used for</h2>
<p>The active ingredient of BRETARIS GENUAIR is aclidinium bromide, which belongs to a group of medicines called bronchodilators. Bronchodilators relax airways and help keep bronchioles open.</p>
<p>BRETARIS GENUAIR is a dry powder inhaler that uses your breath to deliver the medicine directly into your lungs. This makes it easier for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients to breathe.</p>
<p>BRETARIS GENUAIR is indicated to help open the airways and relieve symptoms of COPD, a serious, long-term lung disease characterised by breathing difficulties. Regular use of BRETARIS GENUAIR can help you when you have ongoing shortness of breath related to your disease and will help you to minimise the effects of the disease on your everyday life.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why BRETARIS GENUAIR has been prescribed for you.</strong></p>
<p>This medicine is only available with a doctor’s prescription.</p>
<p>It is not addictive.</p>
<h2>Before you use BRETARIS GENUAIR</h2>
<h3><em>When you must not use it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not use BRETARIS GENUAIR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>if you are allergic to aclidinium bromide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed at the end of this leaflet</li>
<li>if you are allergic to atropine or related bronchodilator medicines, for example ipratropium, tiotropium or oxitropium..</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>shortness of breath</li>
<li>wheezing or difficulty breathing</li>
<li>swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body</li>
<li>rash, itching or hives on the skin.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do not use this medicine after the expiry date printed on the pack or if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering.</strong> In that case, return it to your pharmacist.</p>
<h3><em>Before you start to use it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you have any of the following medical conditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>if you have asthma</li>
<li>if you have had heart problems recently</li>
<li>if you see halos around lights, or coloured images (glaucoma)</li>
<li>if you have an enlarged prostate, problems passing urine, or a blockage in your bladder.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor may want to take special precautions if you have any of the above conditions.</p>
<p>BRETARIS GENUAIR is indicated for maintenance treatment of your chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; it should not be used to treat a sudden attack of breathlessness or wheezing. If your COPD symptoms (breathlessness, wheezing, cough) do not improve or get worse you should contact your doctor for advice as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Dry mouth, which has been observed with medicines like BRETARIS GENUAIR, may, after using your medicine for a long time, be associated with tooth decay. Therefore, please remember to pay attention to oral hygiene.</p>
<p><strong>Stop using BRETARIS GENUAIR and seek medical help immediately:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>if you get tightness of the chest, coughing, wheezing or breathlessness immediately after using the medicine. These may be signs of a condition called bronchospasm.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you require further advice, you should talk with your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, intend to become pregnant or are breastfeeding.</strong> BRETARIS GENUAIR is not recommended for use during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. If it is necessary for you to use this medicine during pregnancy or while breastfeeding, your doctor will discuss with you the benefits and risks involved.</p>
<h3><em>Children and adolescents</em></h3>
<p>BRETARIS GENUAIR is not for use in children or adolescents below 18 years of age.</p>
<h3><em>Taking other medicines</em></h3>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, including any that you get without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.</strong></p>
<p>Some medicines and BRETARIS GENUAIR may interfere with each other. These include medicines containing tiotropium, ipratropium or oxitropium (called anticholinergics).</p>
<p>You may need to take different amounts of your medicines or you may need to take different medicines. Your doctor and pharmacist have more information.</p>
<p><strong>If you have not told your doctor about any of these things, tell him/ her before you start using BRETARIS GENUAIR.</strong></p>
<h2>How to use BRETARIS GENUAIR</h2>
<p><strong>Follow all directions given to you by your doctor and pharmacist carefully.</strong> These directions may differ from the information contained in the leaflet.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not understand the instructions, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How much to use</em></h3>
<p>The recommended dose is one inhalation twice a day in the morning and evening.</p>
<p>The effects of BRETARIS GENUAIR last for 12 hours; therefore, you should try to use your BRETARIS GENUAIR inhaler at the same time every morning and evening. This ensures that there is always enough medicine in your body to help you breathe more easily throughout the day and night. It will also help you to remember to use it.</p>
<h3><em>How to use</em></h3>
<p>See instructions on how to use the BRETARIS GENUAIR inhaler. If you are not sure of how to use BRETARIS GENUAIR, contact your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<h3><em>How long to use</em></h3>
<p><strong>Continue to use this medicine for as long as your doctor tells you to.</strong></p>
<p>If it helps your breathing problems, your doctor may want you to keep using it for a long time.</p>
<p>This medicine helps to control your condition but it does not cure it.</p>
<p>If you want to stop treatment, first talk to your doctor, as your symptoms may worsen.</p>
<h3><em>If you forget to use it</em></h3>
<p><strong>If you forget to have a dose of BRETARIS, inhale the dose as soon as you remember. However, if it is nearly time for your next dose, skip the missed dose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not take a double dose to make up for the one that you missed.</strong> This may increase the chance of you getting an unwanted side effect.</p>
<p><strong>If you have trouble remembering when to use your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints.</strong></p>
<h3><em>If you use too much (overdose)</em></h3>
<p><strong>Immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26) for advice, or go to Accident and Emergency at the nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have used too much BRETARIS. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.</strong></p>
<h2>While you are using BRETARIS GENUAIR</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Use this medicine exactly as your doctor has prescribed. Try not to miss any doses and use it even if you feel well.</strong> If you do not follow your doctor’s instructions, you may not get relief from your breathing problems or you may have unwanted side effects.</p>
<p><strong>If you find that the usual dose of BRETARIS is not giving as much relief as before, or does not last as long as usual, contact your doctor so that your condition can be checked.</strong> This is important to ensure your COPD is controlled properly.</p>
<p><strong>If you become pregnant while using this medicine, tell your doctor.</strong> Your doctor can discuss with you the risks of using it while you are pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>If you are about to be started on any new medicine, remind your doctor and pharmacist that you are using BRETARIS GENUAIR.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell any other doctors, dentists, and pharmacists who treat you that you are using this medicine.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not exceed the recommended daily dose – it will not help you to do this.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not take any other medicines for your breathing problems without checking with your doctor.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not give this medicine to anyone else, even if their condition seems similar to yours.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not use it to treat any other complaints unless your doctor tells you to.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things to be careful of</em></h3>
<p><strong>Be careful driving, operating machinery or doing jobs that require you to be alert until you know how BRETARIS affects you.</strong> This medicine has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. This medicine may cause headache or blurred vision.

<h2>Being given ZOLACOS CP</h2>
<p><strong>Follow all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist carefully.</strong> They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.</p>
<h3><em>How much to take</em></h3>
<p>A ZOLADEX implant will be injected under the skin of your stomach every 28 days for the 3.6mg strength, or once every 3 months for the 10.8mg strength.</p>

Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.</strong></p>
<h2>While you are using it</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Be sure to keep all your appointments with your doctor so your progress can be checked.</strong> This is to ensure that your hormone levels will not rise and your illness will not get worse.</p>

<ul>
<li>have trouble passing urine</li>
<li>feel weak in the arms or legs</li>
<li>feel numb in the arms or legs</li>

<p><strong>If you are about to be started on any new medicine, tell your doctor, dentist or pharmacist that you are taking ZOLACOS CP.</strong></p>
<p><strong>ZOLACOS may affect your sperm (semen) while you are taking it and for some time after you stop taking it. As a precaution, you and/or your partner must use adequate contraception while you are taking ZOLACOS and for at least 130 days after you have stopped taking ZOLACOS.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how ZOLACOS CP affects you.</strong> Some patients may feel dizzy or weak.</p>
<h2>Side effects</h2>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking ZOLACOS CP.</strong></p>
<p>ZOLACOS CP helps people with advanced prostate cancer, but it may have unwanted side effects in some people.</p>
<p>All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical treatment if you get some of the side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you notice any of the following and they worry you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>hot flushes or sweating</li>

<li>decrease in your sexual drive</li>
<li>inability to get or maintain an erection</li>
<li>trouble passing urine or experience lower back pain</li>
<li>your testicles getting smaller</li>
</ul>
<p>ZOLACOS CP may also cause a period of low fertility or infertility whilst you are taking it and for a period afterwards. NOTE however that you may not be infertile. As ZOLACOS CP may affect your sperm, effective contraception must be used by you and/or your partner while you are taking ZOLACOS CP and for at least 130 days after you have stopped taking ZOLACOS CP.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>frequent urination</li>
<li>shortness of breath and dizziness when exercising and looking pale (anaemia)</li>
<li>excessive thirst with weight loss, and passing large amounts of urine</li>
</ul>
<p>These side effects may be serious.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor immediately or go to Accident and Emergency at your nearest hospital if any of the following happen.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>chest pain</li>
<li>yellowing of the skin or eyes and dark coloured urine</li>
<li>rash, hives or severe itching of the skin,</li>
<li>swelling of the face, lips, tongue and/or throat, which may cause difficulty in swallowing</li>
<li>swelling of other parts of the body including hands, feet or ankles</li>
<li>serious breathlessness, or sudden worsening of breathlessness, possibly with a cough or fever.</li>
<li>shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all serious side effects. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice anything that is making you feel unwell.</strong></p>
<p>Some people may get other effects while taking ZOLACOS CP.</p>
<p>Because ZOLACOS CP lowers the amount of sex hormones in your body your sex drive will probably be reduced.</p>
<p>If you have a tumour in your pituitary gland, ZOLACOS CP may make the tumour bleed or collapse. This is very rare but causes severe headaches, sickness, loss of eyesight and unconsciousness.</p>
<p>It is also unlikely that you can father a child while using ZOLACOS CP, but you must use your normal contraceptive method to make sure.</p>
<h2>After using ZOLACOS CP</h2>
<h3><em>Storage</em></h3>
<p><strong>Keep your tablets in the blister foil until it is time to take them.</strong> If you take the tablets out of the blister foil, they will not keep well.</p>
<p><strong>Keep the implant in it's foil packaging until it is time for administration by your doctor</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keep the packaging in a cool dry place where the temperature stays below 25°C.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not store it or any other medicine in the bathroom or near a sink.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not leave it on a window sill or in the car on hot days.</strong> Heat and dampness can destroy some medicines.</p>
<p><strong>Keep your medicine where children cannot reach it.</strong> A locked cupboard at least one-and-a-half metres above the ground is a good place to store medicines.</p>
<h2>Disposal</h2>
<p><strong>Ask your pharmacist what to do with any tablets you have left over if your doctor tells you to stop taking them, or you find that the expiry date has passed. Your doctor will dispose of the syringe appropriately.</strong></p>

Consumer Medicine Information
What is in this leaflet
This leaflet answers some of the common questions people ask about ZOLACOS CP. It does not contain all the information that is known about ZOLACOS CP.
It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.

What ZOLACOS CP is for
ZOLACOS CP combination therapy is the brand name for packs containing ZOLADEX (goserelin) 3.6mg or 10.8mg subcutaneous implant plus COSUDEX (bicalutamide) 50mg tablets.
ZOLACOS CP is used to treat advanced prostate cancer in men. It is not a cure for prostate cancer. Bicalutamide tablets can also be used to treat disease flare associated with previous goserelin therapy.
ZOLACOS CP is a combination pack consisting of an anti-androgen (COSUDEX) medicine and a Luteinising Hormone Releasing Hormone (LHRH) agonist (ZOLADEX).
Androgens such as testosterone are natural male sex hormones. In some types of prostate cancer, androgens may help the cancer cells to grow.
LHRH agonists reduce the level of testosterone in men.
ZOLACOS CP interferes with some of the actions of these hormones.
ZOLACOS CP should only be taken by men.

<hr/>
<p><strong>Consumer Medicine Information</strong></p>
<h2>What is in this leaflet</h2>
<p>This leaflet answers some of the common questions about Zanidip. It does not contain all the available information. It does not replace seeking advice from your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p><strong>Please read this leaflet before you start taking Zanidip.</strong> If you are helping someone else take Zanidip, please read this leaflet before you give the first dose.</p>
<p>All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking Zanidip against the benefits this medicine is expected to have for you.</p>
<p><strong>If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keep this leaflet with the medicine.</strong> You may need to read it again.</p>
<h2>What Zanidip is used for</h2>
<p>The name of your medicine is Zanidip, which is also known as lercanidipine. Zanidip belongs to a group of medicines called calcium channel blockers (of the dihydropyridine group).</p>
<p>Zanidip lowers high blood pressure, which doctors call hypertension. It works by relaxing some of the blood vessels in the body and reducing resistance to the flow of blood through the blood vessels.</p>
<p>Everyone has blood pressure. This pressure helps get your blood all around your body. Your blood pressure may be different at different times of the day, depending on how busy or worried you are. You have hypertension (high blood pressure) when your blood pressure stays higher than is needed, even when you are calm and relaxed.</p>
<p>There are usually no symptoms of hypertension. The only way of knowing that you have hypertension is to have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. If high blood pressure is not treated it can lead to serious health problems. You may feel fine and have no symptoms, but eventually hypertension can cause stroke, heart disease and kidney failure. Zanidip helps lower your blood pressure.</p>
<p>Zanidip cannot be obtained without a doctor's prescription.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that Zanidip is addictive.</p>
<h2>Before you take Zanidip</h2>

<h2>How to take Zanidip</h2>
<h3><em>How much to take</em></h3>
<p><strong>Follow all directions given to you by your doctor carefully.</strong> These directions may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.</p>
<p>The usual dose is one 10 mg tablet taken once daily, but may be increased to 20 mg once daily.</p>
<p>If you do not understand the instructions on the box, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.</p>
<h3><em>How to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Swallow Zanidip whole with a glass of water.</strong></p>
<h3><em>When to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Take Zanidip at about the same time each day, at least 15 minutes before a meal.</strong> Zanidip will have the best effect if it is taken at the same time each day at least 15 minutes before meals. This will also help you remember when to take the tablets.</p>
<h3><em>How long to take it</em></h3>
<p>Zanidip helps control your condition, but does not cure it. Therefore you must take Zanidip every day. Continue taking the tablets for as long as your doctor tells you to.</p>
<h3><em>If you forget to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>If you forget to take a dose but remember within 12 hours from when the dose was due, take it straight away, then continue as normal the next day. Otherwise skip that day's dose but be sure to take the next day's dose when it is due.</strong></p>
<p>If you are not sure about what to do, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p><strong>Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed.</strong></p>
<p>If you have trouble remembering to take your tablets, ask your pharmacist for some hints.</p>
<p>If you have missed several doses, consult your doctor.</p>
<h3><em>If you take too much (overdose)</em></h3>
<p><strong>Immediately telephone your doctor or Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26 or New Zealand 0800 764766), or go to Accident &amp; Emergency at your nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much Zanidip. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. You may need urgent medical attention. Keep telephone numbers of these places/services handy.</strong></p>
<p>If you take too much Zanidip it may cause your blood pressure to become too low and you may feel your heart beats become irregular and faster. It may also lead to unconsciousness.</p>
<h2>While you are using Zanidip</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Use Zanidip exactly as your doctor has prescribed.</strong> If you do not follow your doctor's instructions correctly, your blood pressure may not be controlled.</p>
<p><strong>Be sure to keep all of your doctor's appointments so that your progress can be checked.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you become pregnant while you are taking Zanidip, tell your doctor.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are about to start taking any new medicine, tell your doctor and pharmacist that you are taking Zanidip.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell all other doctors, dentists and pharmacists who are treating you that you are taking Zanidip.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have an operation, tell the anaesthetist that you are taking this medicine.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not give Zanidip to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not use Zanidip to treat any other complaints unless your doctor tells you to.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things to be careful of</em></h3>
<p><strong>Be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how Zanidip affects you.</strong> Zanidip generally does not cause any problems with your ability to drive a car or operate machinery. However, as with other medicines used to treat high blood pressure, a few people may feel dizzy, light-headed or faint, especially when first taking Zanidip or when starting to take a different amount of medicine. Your doctor may also ask you to limit or stop your alcohol intake while taking medicines to control your blood pressure, such as Zanidip, as alcohol may increase these effects.</p>
<p><strong>If you feel light-headed, dizzy or faint when getting out of bed or standing up, get up slowly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As with some medicines used to treat high blood pressure such as Zanidip, you should avoid drinking grapefruit juice as grapefruit juice may increase the effects of these medicines.</strong></p>
<h2>Side Effects</h2>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking Zanidip.</strong></p>
<p>Zanidip helps most people with high blood pressure, but it may have unwanted side effects in a few people. All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical treatment if you get some of the side effects.</p>
<p>Possible side effects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>flushing</li>
<li>swelling of the ankles, feet or lower legs</li>
<li>palpitations</li>
<li>headache</li>
<li>dizziness</li>
<li>gastrointestinal disturbances such as heartburn, nausea, epigastric pain or diarrhoea</li>
<li>fatigue or sleepiness</li>
</ul>
<p>These effects when they occur are usually mild. However, should you experience any of these or other undesirable effects not mentioned above, you should consult your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor immediately or go to Accident &amp; Emergency at your nearest hospital if you notice any of the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>angina (chest pain or tightness)</li>
<li>increased heart beat</li>
<li>signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin</li>
</ul>
<p>These side effects are usually rare but may be serious and need urgent medical attention.</p>
<p>Do not be alarmed by this list of possible side effects. You may not experience any of them.</p>
<h2>After using Zanidip</h2>
<h3><em>Storage</em></h3>
<p><strong>Keep your tablets in the blister pack until it is time to take them.</strong> If you take the tablets out of the blister pack they may not keep well.</p>
<p><strong>Keep it in a cool dry place away from sunlight where the temperature stays below 30°C. Do not store it or any other medicine in the bathroom or near a sink.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not leave it in the car or on window sills.</strong> Heat and dampness can destroy some medicines.</p>
<p><strong>Keep it where children cannot reach it.</strong> A locked cupboard at least one-and-a-half metres above the ground is a good place to store medicines.</p>

Consumer Medicine Information
What is in this leaflet
This leaflet answers some of the common questions about Zanidip. It does not contain all the available information. It does not replace seeking advice from your doctor or pharmacist.
Please read this leaflet before you start taking Zanidip. If you are helping someone else take Zanidip, please read this leaflet before you give the first dose.
All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking Zanidip against the benefits this medicine is expected to have for you.
If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Keep this leaflet with the medicine. You may need to read it again.
What Zanidip is used for
The name of your medicine is Zanidip, which is also known as lercanidipine. Zanidip belongs to a group of medicines called calcium channel blockers (of the dihydropyridine group).
Zanidip lowers high blood pressure, which doctors call hypertension. It works by relaxing some of the blood vessels in the body and reducing resistance to the flow of blood through the blood vessels.
Everyone has blood pressure. This pressure helps get your blood all around your body. Your blood pressure may be different at different times of the day, depending on how busy or worried you are. You have hypertension (high blood pressure) when your blood pressure stays higher than is needed, even when you are calm and relaxed.
There are usually no symptoms of hypertension. The only way of knowing that you have hypertension is to have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. If high blood pressure is not treated it can lead to serious health problems. You may feel fine and have no symptoms, but eventually hypertension can cause stroke, heart disease and kidney failure. Zanidip helps lower your blood pressure.
Zanidip cannot be obtained without a doctor's prescription.
There is no evidence that Zanidip is addictive.
Before you take Zanidip
When you must not take it

Do not take Zanidip if you:

have severe liver or kidney disease
are also taking another medicine called ciclosporin

Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Do not take Zanidip if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Like most calcium channel blockers, Zanidip is not recommended for use during pregnancy.
Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant while you are taking Zanidip.
Do not take Zanidip if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed. Like most calcium channel blockers Zanidip is not recommended while you are breast-feeding.
Do not take Zanidip if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering.
Do not take Zanidip if the tablets show visible sign of deterioration (for example, are broken or discoloured).

<p><strong>If you become pregnant while you are taking Zanidip, tell your doctor.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are about to start taking any new medicine, tell your doctor and pharmacist that you are taking Zanidip.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell all other doctors, dentists and pharmacists who are treating you that you are taking Zanidip.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have an operation, tell the anaesthetist that you are taking this medicine.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not give Zanidip to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not use Zanidip to treat any other complaints unless your doctor tells you to.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things to be careful of</em></h3>
<p><strong>Be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how Zanidip affects you.</strong> Zanidip generally does not cause any problems with your ability to drive a car or operate machinery. However, as with other medicines used to treat high blood pressure, a few people may feel dizzy, light-headed or faint, especially when first taking Zanidip or when starting to take a different amount of medicine. Your doctor may also ask you to limit or stop your alcohol intake while taking medicines to control your blood pressure, such as Zanidip, as alcohol may increase these effects.</p>
<p><strong>If you feel light-headed, dizzy or faint when getting out of bed or standing up, get up slowly.</strong></p>
<p><strong>As with some medicines used to treat high blood pressure such as Zanidip, you should avoid drinking grapefruit juice as grapefruit juice may increase the effects of these medicines.</strong></p>
<h2>Side Effects</h2>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking Zanidip.</strong></p>
<p>Zanidip helps most people with high blood pressure, but it may have unwanted side effects in a few people. All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical treatment if you get some of the side effects.</p>
<p>Possible side effects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>flushing</li>
<li>swelling of the ankles, feet or lower legs</li>
<li>palpitations</li>
<li>headache</li>
<li>dizziness</li>
<li>gastrointestinal disturbances such as heartburn, nausea, epigastric pain or diarrhoea</li>
<li>fatigue or sleepiness</li>
</ul>
<p>These effects when they occur are usually mild. However, should you experience any of these or other undesirable effects not mentioned above, you should consult your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor immediately or go to Accident &amp; Emergency at your nearest hospital if you notice any of the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>angina (chest pain or tightness)</li>
<li>increased heart beat</li>
<li>signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin</li>
</ul>
<p>These side effects are usually rare but may be serious and need urgent medical attention.</p>
<p>Do not be alarmed by this list of possible side effects. You may not experience any of them.</p>
<h2>After using Zanidip</h2>
<h3><em>Storage</em></h3>
<p><strong>Keep your tablets in the blister pack until it is time to take them.</strong> If you take the tablets out of the blister pack they may not keep well.</p>

Consumer Medicine Information
What is in this leaflet
This leaflet answers some of the common questions about Zanidip. It does not contain all the available information. It does not replace seeking advice from your doctor or pharmacist.
Please read this leaflet before you start taking Zanidip. If you are helping someone else take Zanidip, please read this leaflet before you give the first dose.
All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking Zanidip against the benefits this medicine is expected to have for you.
If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Keep this leaflet with the medicine. You may need to read it again.
What Zanidip is used for
The name of your medicine is Zanidip, which is also known as lercanidipine. Zanidip belongs to a group of medicines called calcium channel blockers (of the dihydropyridine group).
Zanidip lowers high blood pressure, which doctors call hypertension. It works by relaxing some of the blood vessels in the body and reducing resistance to the flow of blood through the blood vessels.
Everyone has blood pressure. This pressure helps get your blood all around your body. Your blood pressure may be different at different times of the day, depending on how busy or worried you are. You have hypertension (high blood pressure) when your blood pressure stays higher than is needed, even when you are calm and relaxed.
There are usually no symptoms of hypertension. The only way of knowing that you have hypertension is to have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. If high blood pressure is not treated it can lead to serious health problems. You may feel fine and have no symptoms, but eventually hypertension can cause stroke, heart disease and kidney failure. Zanidip helps lower your blood pressure.
Zanidip cannot be obtained without a doctor's prescription.
There is no evidence that Zanidip is addictive.
Before you take Zanidip
When you must not take it
Do not take Zanidip if you have an allergy to:

lercanidipine or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet
any drugs closely related to lercanidipine (such as amlodipine, felodipine or nifedipine)

Do not take Zanidip if you:

have severe liver or kidney disease
are also taking another medicine called ciclosporin

Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure.
Do not take Zanidip if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Like most calcium channel blockers, Zanidip is not recommended for use during pregnancy.
Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant while you are taking Zanidip.
Do not take Zanidip if you are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed. Like most calcium channel blockers Zanidip is not recommended while you are breast-feeding.
Do not take Zanidip if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering.
Do not take Zanidip if the tablets show visible sign of deterioration (for example, are broken or discoloured).
Do not take Zanidip if the expiry date (EXP) printed on the pack has passed. If you take this medicine after the expiry date has passed, it may not work (as well).
If you are not sure whether you should start taking Zanidip, talk to your doctor.
Do not give Zanidip to a child under the age of 18 years. Zanidip is not recommended for use in children.
Before you start to take it
You must tell your doctor:

if you are allergic to any other medicine or any foods, dyes or preservatives.
if you are taking other drugs for high blood pressure, such as beta-blockers, diuretics, ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists.
if you have or have ever had any other health problems/medical conditions, including:


liver or kidney disease or are on dialysis
certain other heart conditions such as: uncontrolled heart failure, an obstruction to flow of blood from the heart, unstable angina (chest pain or tightness at rest or progressively increasing) or you have had a heart attack one month ago or less and/or if you require a pacemaker

If you have not told your doctor about any of the above or if you are not sure, tell them before you take Zanidip.
Taking other medicines
Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines, including medicines that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.
Some medicines may interfere with the way Zanidip works, or may be affected by Zanidip. These include:

ritonavir, ciclosporin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, fluoxetine, cimetidine (more than 800 mg daily).

You may need different amounts of your medicine, or you may need to take different medicines. Your doctor or pharmacist can tell you what to do if you are taking any of these medicines.
Also ask your doctor or pharmacist what to do if you are taking, or are about to take the following medicines: phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampicin, amiodarone, quinidine, digoxin, simvastatin, metoprolol or propranolol.
If you have not told your doctor about any of the medicines listed above, tell them before you start taking Zanidip.
How to take Zanidip
How much to take
Follow all directions given to you by your doctor carefully. These directions may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.
The usual dose is one 10 mg tablet taken once daily, but may be increased to 20 mg once daily.
If you do not understand the instructions on the box, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.
How to take it
Swallow Zanidip whole with a glass of water.
When to take it
Take Zanidip at about the same time each day, at least 15 minutes before a meal. Zanidip will have the best effect if it is taken at the same time each day at least 15 minutes before meals. This will also help you remember when to take the tablets.
How long to take it
Zanidip helps control your condition, but does not cure it. Therefore you must take Zanidip every day. Continue taking the tablets for as long as your doctor tells you to.
If you forget to take it
If you forget to take a dose but remember within 12 hours from when the dose was due, take it straight away, then continue as normal the next day. Otherwise skip that day's dose but be sure to take the next day's dose when it is due.
If you are not sure about what to do, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed.
If you have trouble remembering to take your tablets, ask your pharmacist for some hints.
If you have missed several doses, consult your doctor.
If you take too much (overdose)
Immediately telephone your doctor or Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26 or New Zealand 0800 764766), or go to Accident  Emergency at your nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much Zanidip. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. You may need urgent medical attention. Keep telephone numbers of these places/services handy.
If you take too much Zanidip it may cause your blood pressure to become too low and you may feel your heart beats become irregular and faster. It may also lead to unconsciousness.
While you are using Zanidip
Things you must do
Use Zanidip exactly as your doctor has prescribed. If you do not follow your doctor's instructions correctly, your blood pressure may not be controlled.
Be sure to keep all of your doctor's appointments so that your progress can be checked.
If you become pregnant while you are taking Zanidip, tell your doctor.
If you are about to start taking any new medicine, tell your doctor and pharmacist that you are taking Zanidip.
Tell all other doctors, dentists and pharmacists who are treating you that you are taking Zanidip.
If you have an operation, tell the anaesthetist that you are taking this medicine.
Things you must not do
Do not give Zanidip to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.
Do not use Zanidip to treat any other complaints unless your doctor tells you to.
Things to be careful of
Be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how Zanidip affects you. Zanidip generally does not cause any problems with your ability to drive a car or operate machinery. However, as with other medicines used to treat high blood pressure, a few people may feel dizzy, light-headed or faint, especially when first taking Zanidip or when starting to take a different amount of medicine. Your doctor may also ask you to limit or stop your alcohol intake while taking medicines to control your blood pressure, such as Zanidip, as alcohol may increase these effects.
If you feel light-headed, dizzy or faint when getting out of bed or standing up, get up slowly.
As with some medicines used to treat high blood pressure such as Zanidip, you should avoid drinking grapefruit juice as grapefruit juice may increase the effects of these medicines.
Side Effects
Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking Zanidip.
Zanidip helps most people with high blood pressure, but it may have unwanted side effects in a few people. All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical treatment if you get some of the side effects.
Possible side effects include:

flushing
swelling of the ankles, feet or lower legs
palpitations
headache
dizziness
gastrointestinal disturbances such as heartburn, nausea, epigastric pain or diarrhoea
fatigue or sleepiness

These effects when they occur are usually mild. However, should you experience any of these or other undesirable effects not mentioned above, you should consult your doctor or pharmacist.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.
Tell your doctor immediately or go to Accident  Emergency at your nearest hospital if you notice any of the following:

angina (chest pain or tightness)
increased heart beat
signs of allergy such as rash, itching or hives on the skin

These side effects are usually rare but may be serious and need urgent medical attention.
Do not be alarmed by this list of possible side effects. You may not experience any of them.
After using Zanidip

<h3><em>How much to take</em></h3>
<p>Your doctor will tell you how much of this medicine you should take. This will depend on your condition and whether you are taking any other medicines.</p>
<p>Do not stop taking your medicine or change your dosage without first checking with your doctor.</p>
<p>For major depressive disorder, the recommended dose is usually one 60 mg capsule once daily.</p>
<p>For generalised anxiety disorder, the recommended dose is 30 mg to 120 mg, taken once daily.</p>

<p>Do not open the capsules and crush the pellets inside because the medicine may not work as well. Duloxetine may be taken with or without meals.</p>

<p>Continue taking your medicine for as long as your doctor tells you.</p>
<p>Make sure you have enough to last over weekends and holidays.</p>

<p><strong>Do not take a double dose to make up for missed doses.</strong> This may increase the chance of you experiencing side effects.</p>
<p>If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints to help you remember.</p>
<h3><em>If you take too much (overdose)</em></h3>
<p><strong>If you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much of this medicine, immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (Tel: 13 11 26 in Australia) for advice. Alternatively go to the Accident and Emergency Department at your nearest hospital.</strong></p>

<p>Symptoms of an overdose may include drowsiness, convulsions and vomiting. They may also include feeling confused, feeling restless, sweating, shaking, shivering, hallucinations, muscle jerks, or fast heartbeat.</p>
<h2>While you are taking this medicine</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p>Tell your doctor that you are taking this medicine if you:</p>

</ul>
<p>Tell any other doctors, dentists and pharmacists who are treating you that you take this medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor immediately if you have any suicidal thoughts or other mental/mood changes.</strong></p>
<p>Occasionally, the symptoms of depression or other psychiatric conditions may include thoughts of harming yourself or committing suicide. These symptoms may continue or get worse during the first one or two months of treatment, until the full antidepressant effect of the medicine becomes apparent. This is more likely to occur in young adults under 25 years of age.</p>
<p><strong>All mention of suicide or violence must be taken seriously. Contact your doctor or a mental health professional right away or go to the nearest hospital for treatment if you or someone you know is showing any of the following warning signs of suicide:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>worsening of your depression</li>
<li>thoughts or talk of death or suicide</li>
<li>thoughts or talk of self-harm or harm to others</li>
<li>any recent attempts of self-harm</li>
<li>increase in aggressive behaviour, irritability or any other unusual changes in behaviour or mood.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you notice any of the following, contact your doctor immediately:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>itchy skin</li>
<li>dark urine</li>
<li>yellowing of the skin or eyes</li>
<li>tenderness over the liver</li>
<li>symptoms of the 'flu'.</li>
</ul>
<p>These could be signs of liver damage.</p>
<p>Your doctor may occasionally do tests to make sure the medicine is working and to prevent side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Visit your doctor regularly for a check-up.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Give this medicine to anyone else, even if their symptoms seem similar to yours</li>
<li>Take your medicine to treat any other condition unless your doctor tells you to</li>
<li>Stop taking your medicine, or change the dosage, without first checking with your doctor.</li>
</ul>
<h3><em>Things to be careful of</em></h3>
<p>Be careful when driving or operating machinery until you know how this medicine affects you. It may cause dizziness or drowsiness.</p>
<p><strong>Be careful when drinking alcohol while you are taking this medicine.</strong> You should avoid 'binge drinking' or drinking excessively during treatment with duloxetine as it can cause severe liver injury.</p>
<p>Drinking alcohol with duloxetine may also cause dizziness or drowsiness in some people. If you have any of these symptoms, do not drive, operate machinery or do anything else that could be dangerous.</p>

What is in this leaflet
Read this leaflet carefully before taking your medicine.
This leaflet answers some common questions about duloxetine. It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.
The information in this leaflet was last updated on the date listed on the last page. More recent information on this medicine may be available.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist:

if there is anything you do not understand in this leaflet,
if you are worried about taking your medicine, or
to obtain the most up-to-date information.

You can also download the most up-to-date leaflet from www.apotex.com.au. All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you using this medicine against the benefits they expect it will have for you.

What this medicine is used for
The name of your medicine is APO-Duloxetine. It contains the active ingredient duloxetine hydrochloride.

How it works
Duloxetine belongs to a group of medicines called serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). SNRIs are believed to work by their action on serotonin and noradrenaline in the brain.

How to take this medicine

How much to take
Your doctor will tell you how much of this medicine you should take. This will depend on your condition and whether you are taking any other medicines.
Do not stop taking your medicine or change your dosage without first checking with your doctor.
For major depressive disorder, the recommended dose is usually one 60 mg capsule once daily.
For generalised anxiety disorder, the recommended dose is 30 mg to 120 mg, taken once daily.

How to take it
Swallow the capsule whole with a full glass of water.

<p><strong>Consumer Medicine Information</strong></p>
<h2>What is in this leaflet</h2>
<p>This leaflet answers some common questions about Dulcolax. It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p><strong>All medicines have risks and benefits. If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p>This leaflet was last updated on the date at the end of this leaflet. More recent information may be available. The latest Consumer Medicine Information is available from your pharmacist, doctor, or from www.medicines.org.au and may contain important information about the medicine and its use of which you should be aware.</p>
<p><strong>Keep this information with the medicine.</strong> You may need to read it again.</p>
<h2>What Dulcolax is used for</h2>
<p>Dulcolax is used to treat constipation.</p>
<p>Under medical supervision, Dulcolax can be used for the evacuation of the bowel before a radiological examination or as an enema alternative.</p>
<p>Dulcolax works by acting on the lining of the lower bowel to stimulate movement and promotes accumulation of water into the bowel to produce soft formed stools.</p>
<p>Dulcolax is ineffective in altering the digestion or absorption of calories in the small intestine and therefore does not assist with weight loss.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you.</strong> Your doctor may have prescribed it for another reason.</p>
<h2>Before you use Dulcolax</h2>
<h3><em>When you must not use it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not use Dulcolax if you are allergic to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>any medicine containing bisacodyl</li>
<li>any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do not use Dulcolax if you have or have had, any of the following conditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>acute abdominal conditions including appendicitis</li>
<li>acute inflammatory bowel disease</li>
<li>severe abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting</li>
<li>blockage in the bowel (ileus)</li>
<li>a blockage in the intestine</li>
<li>severe dehydration.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are uncertain as to whether you have, or have had, any of these conditions, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not give this medicine to a child under the age of 10 years.</strong> There is not enough information to recommend the use of this medicine for children under the age of 10 years.</p>
<p><strong>Do not use this medicine after the expiry date printed on the pack or if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering.</strong> If it has expired or is damaged, return it to your pharmacist for disposal.</p>
<h3><em>Before you start to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have, or have had, any other medical conditions including:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>an anal fissure (painful tear in the lining of the anus)</li>
<li>ulcerative proctitis (inflammation of the rectum).</li>
</ul>
<p>Suppositories may cause pain and local irritation, especially if you have a painful tear in the lining of the anus or inflammation of the rectum.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you have any allergies to any other medicines or any other substances, such as foods, preservatives or dyes.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Taking other medicines</em></h3>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, including any that you get without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In particular, you should tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>diuretics (medicines that increase urine volume)</li>
<li>corticosteroids</li>
<li>medicines which stimulate the heart e.g. digoxin.</li>
</ul>
<p>These medicines may be affected by Dulcolax or may affect how well it works. You may need different amounts of your medicines, or may need to take different medicines.</p>
<p>Your doctor and pharmacist have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while taking this medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or are breastfeeding.</strong> Your doctor can discuss with you the risks and benefits involved.</p>
<p>Dulcolax does not pass into breast milk and can be used during breastfeeding.</p>
<p><strong>If you have not told your doctor or pharmacist about any of the above, tell him/her before you start using Dulcolax.</strong></p>
<h2>How to use Dulcolax</h2>
<p><strong>Follow the directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist carefully.</strong> They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not understand the instructions on the pack, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How much to use</em></h3>
<p>Dulcolax should be used in children only on medical advice. Dulcolax suppositories may be used in children 10 years of age and over.</p>
<p>The usual doses for adults and children over 10 years are stated below.</p>
<p><strong>For Constipation</strong> <br>

<p><strong>If your doctor or pharmacist has changed the recommended dose, ask for further information from your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How to use it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Follow the directions below to use Dulcolax suppositories:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.</li>
<li>Remove all of the foil wrapper from the suppository.</li>
<li>Lie on your side and raise your knee to your chest.</li>
<li>Push the suppository gently and slowly, pointed end first, into the rectum</li>
<li>Throw away used materials and wash your hands thoroughly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dulcolax suppositories generally work in about 20 minutes, but may take up to 45 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>If you are not sure how to use a suppository, ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>After taking Dulcolax, avoid straining while passing a bowel motion.</strong></p>
<h3><em>When to use it</em></h3>
<p>Dulcolax should be used as needed to relieve constipation.</p>
<h3><em>How long to use it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Dulcolax is recommended for short-term use only. If symptoms persist, seek medical advice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Long-term use of Dulcolax is not recommended. If you use Dulcolax every day, you should consult with your doctor to find out the cause of your constipation.</strong> Long-term and excessive use may cause the bowel to become dependent on Dulcolax for it to produce a bowel motion.</p>
<p><strong>If you are not sure how long to use Dulcolax, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.</strong> Long-term and excessive use of Dulcolax may cause an imbalance of salts in the body (including low potassium), muscle weakness, kidney problems and fluid imbalance. Loss of fluids from the body can cause dehydration. Symptoms of dehydration include thirst and passing less urine than normal. In patients experiencing fluid loss where dehydration may be harmful (for example, kidney problems, elderly patients), Dulcolax should be stopped and only restarted under medical supervision.</p>
<h3><em>If you use too much (overdose)</em></h3>
<p><strong>Seek medical advice immediately if you have used more than the recommended or prescribed dose of Dulcolax.</strong> Advice can be provided by your doctor, pharmacist or Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26).</p>
<p>If you have taken too much Dulcolax, you may have diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, fluid loss, and an imbalance of salts in the body (including low potassium).</p>
<p>As with other laxatives, persistent overdose may cause diarrhoea, abdominal pain, imbalance of salts in the body (including low potassium), secondary hyperaldosteronism and kidney stones. If an imbalance of salts (low potassium) occurs, then kidney disease, metabolic alkalosis and muscle weakness may be experienced.</p>
<h2>While you are using Dulcolax</h2>
<h3><em>Things to consider</em></h3>
<p><strong>If you are about to be started on any new medicine, remind your doctor and pharmacist that you are using Dulcolax.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Drink plenty of water while taking laxatives.</strong> An increase in fibre in your diet is recommended, except in cases of medication-induced constipation.</p>
<p><strong>Discuss with your doctor or pharmacist if you need to increase the fibre in your diet when using Dulcolax, to assist in the treatment of constipation.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things to be careful of</em></h3>
<p><strong>Be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how Dulcolax affects you. Do not drive or operate machinery if you experience dizziness or fainting.</strong></p>
<p><strong>After using Dulcolax, avoid straining while passing a bowel motion.</strong> Dizziness and fainting while straining have been reported in patients who have taken Dulcolax. It is not known if Dulcolax can cause dizziness or fainting.</p>
<h2>Side effects</h2>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are using Dulcolax.</strong> All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical attention if you get some of the side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Do not be alarmed by the following list of side effects. You may not experience any of them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you notice any of the following and they worry you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>colitis</li>
<li>abdominal discomfort</li>
<li>abdominal cramps</li>
<li>abdominal pain</li>
<li>nausea</li>
<li>vomiting</li>

<li>anorectal discomfort</li>
<li>blood in the stool</li>
<li>dehydration</li>
<li>dizziness</li>
<li>fainting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Abdominal pain and diarrhoea are the most commonly reported side effects. These side effects are usually mild and short lived.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor immediately or go to casualty at your nearest hospital if you notice any of the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>rash, itching or hives on the skin,</li>
<li>swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body,</li>
<li>shortness of breath, wheezing or trouble breathing.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the symptoms of life-threatening allergic (anaphylactic) reactions.</p>
<p>These are serious side effects. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation. Serious side effects are rare.</p>
<p>Other side effects not listed above may also occur in some patients.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you notice anything else that is making you feel unwell.</strong></p>

Consumer Medicine Information
What is in this leaflet
This leaflet answers some common questions about Dulcolax. It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.
All medicines have risks and benefits. If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
This leaflet was last updated on the date at the end of this leaflet. More recent information may be available. The latest Consumer Medicine Information is available from your pharmacist, doctor, or from www.medicines.org.au and may contain important information about the medicine and its use of which you should be aware.
Keep this information with the medicine. You may need to read it again.
What Dulcolax is used for
Dulcolax is used to treat constipation.
Under medical supervision, Dulcolax can be used for the evacuation of the bowel before a radiological examination or as an enema alternative.
Dulcolax works by acting on the lining of the lower bowel to stimulate movement and promotes accumulation of water into the bowel to produce soft formed stools.
Dulcolax is ineffective in altering the digestion or absorption of calories in the small intestine and therefore does not assist with weight loss.
Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you. Your doctor may have prescribed it for another reason.
Before you use Dulcolax
When you must not use it
Do not use Dulcolax if you are allergic to:

any medicine containing bisacodyl
any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet.

Do not use Dulcolax if you have or have had, any of the following conditions:

acute abdominal conditions including appendicitis
acute inflammatory bowel disease
severe abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting
blockage in the bowel (ileus)
a blockage in the intestine
severe dehydration.

If you are uncertain as to whether you have, or have had, any of these conditions, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
Do not give this medicine to a child under the age of 10 years. There is not enough information to recommend the use of this medicine for children under the age of 10 years.
Do not use this medicine after the expiry date printed on the pack or if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering. If it has expired or is damaged, return it to your pharmacist for disposal.
Before you start to take it
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have, or have had, any other medical conditions including:

an anal fissure (painful tear in the lining of the anus)
ulcerative proctitis (inflammation of the rectum).

Suppositories may cause pain and local irritation, especially if you have a painful tear in the lining of the anus or inflammation of the rectum.
Tell your doctor if you have any allergies to any other medicines or any other substances, such as foods, preservatives or dyes.
Taking other medicines
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, including any that you get without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.
In particular, you should tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking:

diuretics (medicines that increase urine volume)
corticosteroids
medicines which stimulate the heart e.g. digoxin.

These medicines may be affected by Dulcolax or may affect how well it works. You may need different amounts of your medicines, or may need to take different medicines.
Your doctor and pharmacist have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while taking this medicine.
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or are breastfeeding. Your doctor can discuss with you the risks and benefits involved.
Dulcolax does not pass into breast milk and can be used during breastfeeding.
If you have not told your doctor or pharmacist about any of the above, tell him/her before you start using Dulcolax.

<p>It also contains the active ingredient amlodipine besilate. Amlodipine belongs to a group of medicines called calcium channel blockers.</p>
<p>Calcium channel blockers do not change the amount of calcium in your blood or bones.</p>
<p>REAPTAN has been prescribed for you by your doctor to replace the separate tablets of perindopril and amlodipine you were taking.</p>
<p>One REAPTAN tablet replaces separate tablets of perindopril and amlodipine.</p>
<h2>WHAT REAPTAN IS USED FOR</h2>
<p>You have been prescribed REAPTAN if you have high blood pressure, also known as hypertension.</p>
<h3><em>Why REAPTAN is used for high blood pressure</em></h3>
<p>Everyone has blood pressure. This pressure helps get your blood all around the body. Your blood pressure may be different at different times of the day, depending on how busy or stressed you are.</p>
<p>You have high blood pressure when your blood pressure stays higher than is needed, even when you are calm or relaxed.</p>
<p>There are usually no symptoms of high blood pressure. The only way of knowing that you have it is to have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. If high blood pressure is not treated it can lead to serious health problems. You may feel fine and have no symptoms, but eventually it can cause stroke, heart disease and kidney failure.</p>
<p>The active ingredients in REAPTAN, perindopril arginine and amlodipine help lower your blood pressure.</p>
<p>You may also have been prescribed REAPTAN if you have coronary heart disease.</p>
<h3><em>Why REAPTAN is used for coronary heart disease</em></h3>
<p>Coronary heart disease is narrowing of the vessels carrying blood to the heart.</p>
<p>In patients with coronary artery disease, REAPTAN has been shown to reduce some of the risks, including heart attacks.</p>
<h2>HOW REAPTAN WORKS</h2>
<p>REAPTAN works by widening your blood vessels, which reduces pressure in the vessel, making it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body</p>
<p>This helps increase the supply of oxygen to your heart, so that when you place extra demands on your heart, such as during exercise, your heart may cope better and you may not get short of breath as easily.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why REAPTAN has been prescribed for you.</strong></p>
<p>REAPTAN is available only with a doctor's prescription.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that REAPTAN is addictive.</p>
<h2>BEFORE YOU TAKE REAPTAN</h2>
<p>There are some people who shouldn't take REAPTAN. Please read the list below.</p>
<p><strong>If you think any of these situations apply to you or you have any questions, please consult your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Do not take REAPTAN if:</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>you are allergic to perindopril or amlodipine, or any of the other ingredients of REAPTAN listed at the end of this leaflet</strong></li>
<li><strong>you have had an allergic reaction to any other ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers</strong> <br>
Symptoms of an allergic reaction to REAPTAN may include skin rash, itchiness, shortness of breath, swelling of the face, lips or tongue, muscle pain or tenderness or joint pain</br></li>
<li><strong>are pregnant or trying to become pregnant</strong> <br/>
REAPTAN may affect your developing baby if you take it during pregnancy.</li>
<li><strong>are breastfeeding or plan to breast-feed</strong> <br/>
REAPTAN passes into breast milk and therefore there is a possibility that the breast-fed baby may be affected.</li>
<li><strong>are undergoing treatments where your blood is treated outside of the body (also known as extracorporeal treatments) that may increase your risk of allergic reactions, treatments such as:<br/>
- renal dialysis or haemofiltration using polyacrylonitrile membranes<br/>
- low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis, a technique where LDL is 'filtered' out of the blood, using dextran sulphate.</strong></li>
<li><strong>you are treated with a blood pressure lowering medicine containing aliskiren and have diabetes or impaired kidney function</strong></li>
<li><strong>have renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys)</strong></li>
<li><strong>have aortic stenosis (narrowing of the main blood vessel leaving from the heart)</strong></li>
<li><strong>have severe hypotension (low blood pressure)</strong></li>
<li><strong>have unstable angina.</strong> <br/>
Unstable angina is a pain or uncomfortable feeling in the chest that lasts longer than a few minutes or occurs with rest, and may not be relieved with medication</li>
<li><strong>have cardiogenic shock which is a sudden and severe drop in blood pressure and blood flow through the body because the heart is not pumping normally</strong></li>
<li><strong>have heart failure during the first 28 days after a heart attack (Heart failure means that the heart muscle cannot pump blood strongly enough to supply all the blood needed throughout the body. It does not mean that the heart stops working)</strong></li>
<li><strong>have experienced swelling of the face, tongue, lips or throat either spontaneously or in response to another medicine in the past. (This rare condition is known as angio-oedema)</strong></li>
<li><strong>the packaging is damaged or shows sign of tampering</strong></li>
<li><strong>the expiry date (EXP) on the pack has passed.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you think any of these situations apply to you, or you have any doubts or questions about taking REAPTAN speak to your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<h3><em>For older people and patients with renal impairment</em></h3>
<p>REAPTAN can generally be used safely by elderly people.</p>
<p>Reduced kidney function is often found in elderly people and in this case, the starting dose should always be 2.5 mg of perindopril arginine and 2.5 mg of amlodipine taken as separate tablets.</p>
<h3><em>For children</em></h3>
<p>REAPTAN is not recommended for children.</p>
<h3><em>Driving and using machines</em></h3>
<p><strong>REAPTAN may affect your ability to drive or use machines. If the tablets make you feel sick, dizzy, weak or tired, or give you a headache, do not drive or use machines and contact your doctor immediately.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Tell your doctor straight away if:</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>you are pregnant or become pregnant while taking REAPTAN, as it may cause serious harm to your baby.</strong></li>
<li><strong>you are undergoing desensitisation treatment, or have had an allergic reaction during previous desensitisation treatment (e.g. treatments using bee, wasp or ant venom).</strong></li>
<li><strong>you are undergoing, or you are intending to undergo, treatments where your blood is treated outside of the body (also known as extracorporeal treatments)you are to undergo anaesthesia and/or surgery.</strong></li>
<li><strong>you have recently suffered from diarrhoea or vomiting.</strong></li>
<li><strong>you are on a salt restricted diet or use salt substitutes which contain potassium.</strong></li>
<li><strong>you have an intolerance to some sugars as REAPTAN contains lactose.</strong></li>
<li><strong>you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:<br/>
- an 'angiotensin II receptor blocker' (also known as ARBs or sartans - for example valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan), in particular if you have diabetes-related kidney problems<br/>
- aliskiren.</strong></li>
<li><strong>you are treated with immunosuppressant therapy or allopurinol or procainamide.</strong></li>
<li><strong>you have any other health problems, including:<br/>
- kidney disease or if you are on renal dialysis<br/>
- liver disease<br/>
- high or low levels of potassium, or other problems with salt balance<br/>
- diabetes<br/>
- heart disease, severe increase in blood pressure or other heart problems<br/>
- Systemic lupus erythematous or scleroderma (a disease affecting the skin, joints and kidneys)<br/>
- Primary hyperaldosteronism.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you think any of these situations apply to you, or you have any doubts or questions about taking REAPTAN consult your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Taking other medicines</em></h3>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines, including medicines you buy without a prescription from a pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.</strong></p>

<h2>HOW TO TAKE REAPTAN</h2>
<p><strong>Follow all directions given to you by your doctor and pharmacist carefully. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you do not understand the instructions on the label, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How much to take</em></h3>
<p>Your doctor will select a dose when they prescribe REAPTAN for you. The usual dose is one tablet once daily.</p>
<h3><em>How to take it</em></h3>
<p>Swallow your tablet(s) with a glass of water.</p>
<p>Grapefruit juice and grapefruit should not be consumed by people who are taking REAPTAN. This is because grapefruit and grapefruit juice can lead to an increase in the blood levels of the active ingredient amlodipine, which can cause an unpredictable increase in the blood pressure lowering effect of REAPTAN.</p>
<h3><em>When to take it</em></h3>
<p>Take REAPTAN at about the same time each day unless your doctor tells you otherwise.</p>
<p>Taking your tablet at the same time each day will have the best effect. It will also help you remember when to take the tablets.</p>
<h3><em>REAPTAN should be taken in the morning before a meal. If you forget to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to. Otherwise, take it as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking it as you would normally.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How long to take it for</em></h3>
<p>REAPTAN helps control your blood pressure and/or treat your coronary heart disease but does not cure it. Continue taking the tablets for as long as your doctor tells you.</p>
<h3><em>If you take too much</em></h3>
<p><strong>Immediately telephone your doctor, or the Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26 in Australia) if you think you or anyone else may have taken too much REAPTAN. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.</strong></p>
<h2>WHILE YOU ARE TAKING REAPTAN</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p><strong>If you become pregnant while you are taking REAPTAN, tell your doctor.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are about to be started on any new medicine, remind your doctor and pharmacist that you are taking REAPTAN.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell all doctors, dentists and pharmacists involved with your treatment that you are taking REAPTAN.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Take REAPTAN exactly as your doctor has prescribed. Otherwise you may not get the benefits from treatment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If any of the signs below occur then tell your doctor immediately or go to the Accident and Emergency department at your nearest hospital.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>swelling of your lips, face, mouth, tongue or throat.</strong></li>
<li><strong>purple spots with occasional blisters on the front of your arms and legs and/or around your neck and ears (a rare condition known as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome).</strong></li>
<li><strong>severe blisters, skin rash, itching or other allergic reactions.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These side effects are extremely rare but can become serious.</p>
<p><strong>If you have stopped treatment with REAPTAN due to an allergic reaction you should not start taking REAPTAN again.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>do not give REAPTAN to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.</strong></li>
<li><strong>do not use REAPTAN to treat other complaints unless your doctor tells you to.</strong></li>
<li><strong>do not stop taking REAPTAN or change the dosage, without checking with your doctor.</strong></li>
<li><strong>do not stop taking your tablets because you are feeling better, unless advised by your doctor.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><em>Things that may help your condition</em></h3>
<p>Some self - help measures suggested below may help your condition. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about these measures and for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol - your doctor may advise you to limit your alcohol intake</li>
<li>Diet - eat a healthy low-fat diet which includes plenty of fresh vegetables, fruit, bread, cereals and fish. Also eat less fat and sugar</li>
<li>Exercise - regular exercise helps to reduce blood pressure and helps get the heart fitter, but it is important not to overdo it. Walking is good exercise, but try to find a route that is reasonably flat. Before starting any exercise, ask your doctor about the best kind of program for you</li>
<li>Salt - your doctor may advise you to watch the amount of salt in your diet. To reduce your salt intake you should avoid using salt in cooking or at the table</li>
<li>Smoking - your doctor may advise you to stop or at least cut down smoking</li>
<li>Weight - your doctor may suggest losing some weight to help lower your blood pressure and help lessen the amount of work your heart has to do. Some people may need a dietician's help to lose weight.</li>
</ul>

REAPTAN has been prescribed for you by your doctor to replace the separate tablets of perindopril and amlodipine you were taking.
One REAPTAN tablet replaces separate tablets of perindopril and amlodipine.
WHAT REAPTAN IS USED FOR
You have been prescribed REAPTAN if you have high blood pressure, also known as hypertension.
Why REAPTAN is used for high blood pressure
Everyone has blood pressure. This pressure helps get your blood all around the body. Your blood pressure may be different at different times of the day, depending on how busy or stressed you are.
You have high blood pressure when your blood pressure stays higher than is needed, even when you are calm or relaxed.
There are usually no symptoms of high blood pressure. The only way of knowing that you have it is to have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. If high blood pressure is not treated it can lead to serious health problems. You may feel fine and have no symptoms, but eventually it can cause stroke, heart disease and kidney failure.
The active ingredients in REAPTAN, perindopril arginine and amlodipine help lower your blood pressure.
You may also have been prescribed REAPTAN if you have coronary heart disease.
Why REAPTAN is used for coronary heart disease
Coronary heart disease is narrowing of the vessels carrying blood to the heart.
In patients with coronary artery disease, REAPTAN has been shown to reduce some of the risks, including heart attacks.
HOW REAPTAN WORKS
REAPTAN works by widening your blood vessels, which reduces pressure in the vessel, making it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body
This helps increase the supply of oxygen to your heart, so that when you place extra demands on your heart, such as during exercise, your heart may cope better and you may not get short of breath as easily.
Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why REAPTAN has been prescribed for you.
REAPTAN is available only with a doctor's prescription.
There is no evidence that REAPTAN is addictive.
BEFORE YOU TAKE REAPTAN
There are some people who shouldn't take REAPTAN. Please read the list below.
If you think any of these situations apply to you or you have any questions, please consult your doctor or pharmacist.
Do not take REAPTAN if:

you are allergic to perindopril or amlodipine, or any of the other ingredients of REAPTAN listed at the end of this leaflet
you have had an allergic reaction to any other ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers 
Symptoms of an allergic reaction to REAPTAN may include skin rash, itchiness, shortness of breath, swelling of the face, lips or tongue, muscle pain or tenderness or joint pain
are pregnant or trying to become pregnant 
REAPTAN may affect your developing baby if you take it during pregnancy.
are breastfeeding or plan to breast-feed 
REAPTAN passes into breast milk and therefore there is a possibility that the breast-fed baby may be affected.
are undergoing treatments where your blood is treated outside of the body (also known as extracorporeal treatments) that may increase your risk of allergic reactions, treatments such as:
- renal dialysis or haemofiltration using polyacrylonitrile membranes

have cardiogenic shock which is a sudden and severe drop in blood pressure and blood flow through the body because the heart is not pumping normally
have heart failure during the first 28 days after a heart attack (Heart failure means that the heart muscle cannot pump blood strongly enough to supply all the blood needed throughout the body. It does not mean that the heart stops working)
have experienced swelling of the face, tongue, lips or throat either spontaneously or in response to another medicine in the past. (This rare condition is known as angio-oedema)
the packaging is damaged or shows sign of tampering
the expiry date (EXP) on the pack has passed.

HOW TO TAKE REAPTAN
Follow all directions given to you by your doctor and pharmacist carefully. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.
If you do not understand the instructions on the label, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.
How much to take
Your doctor will select a dose when they prescribe REAPTAN for you. The usual dose is one tablet once daily.
How to take it
Swallow your tablet(s) with a glass of water.
Grapefruit juice and grapefruit should not be consumed by people who are taking REAPTAN. This is because grapefruit and grapefruit juice can lead to an increase in the blood levels of the active ingredient amlodipine, which can cause an unpredictable increase in the blood pressure lowering effect of REAPTAN.
When to take it
Take REAPTAN at about the same time each day unless your doctor tells you otherwise.
Taking your tablet at the same time each day will have the best effect. It will also help you remember when to take the tablets.
REAPTAN should be taken in the morning before a meal. If you forget to take it
If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to. Otherwise, take it as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking it as you would normally.
Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed.
How long to take it for
REAPTAN helps control your blood pressure and/or treat your coronary heart disease but does not cure it. Continue taking the tablets for as long as your doctor tells you.
If you take too much
Immediately telephone your doctor, or the Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26 in Australia) if you think you or anyone else may have taken too much REAPTAN. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.
WHILE YOU ARE TAKING REAPTAN

<h2>HOW TO TAKE REAPTAN</h2>
<p><strong>Follow all directions given to you by your doctor and pharmacist carefully. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you do not understand the instructions on the label, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How much to take</em></h3>
<p>Your doctor will select a dose when they prescribe REAPTAN for you. The usual dose is one tablet once daily.</p>
<h3><em>How to take it</em></h3>
<p>Swallow your tablet(s) with a glass of water.</p>
<p>Grapefruit juice and grapefruit should not be consumed by people who are taking REAPTAN. This is because grapefruit and grapefruit juice can lead to an increase in the blood levels of the active ingredient amlodipine, which can cause an unpredictable increase in the blood pressure lowering effect of REAPTAN.</p>
<h3><em>When to take it</em></h3>
<p>Take REAPTAN at about the same time each day unless your doctor tells you otherwise.</p>
<p>Taking your tablet at the same time each day will have the best effect. It will also help you remember when to take the tablets.</p>
<h3><em>REAPTAN should be taken in the morning before a meal. If you forget to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to. Otherwise, take it as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking it as you would normally.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How long to take it for</em></h3>
<p>REAPTAN helps control your blood pressure and/or treat your coronary heart disease but does not cure it. Continue taking the tablets for as long as your doctor tells you.</p>
<h3><em>If you take too much</em></h3>
<p><strong>Immediately telephone your doctor, or the Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26 in Australia) if you think you or anyone else may have taken too much REAPTAN. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.</strong></p>
<h2>WHILE YOU ARE TAKING REAPTAN</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p><strong>If you become pregnant while you are taking REAPTAN, tell your doctor.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are about to be started on any new medicine, remind your doctor and pharmacist that you are taking REAPTAN.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell all doctors, dentists and pharmacists involved with your treatment that you are taking REAPTAN.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Take REAPTAN exactly as your doctor has prescribed. Otherwise you may not get the benefits from treatment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If any of the signs below occur then tell your doctor immediately or go to the Accident and Emergency department at your nearest hospital.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>swelling of your lips, face, mouth, tongue or throat.</strong></li>
<li><strong>purple spots with occasional blisters on the front of your arms and legs and/or around your neck and ears (a rare condition known as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome).</strong></li>
<li><strong>severe blisters, skin rash, itching or other allergic reactions.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These side effects are extremely rare but can become serious.</p>
<p><strong>If you have stopped treatment with REAPTAN due to an allergic reaction you should not start taking REAPTAN again.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>do not give REAPTAN to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.</strong></li>
<li><strong>do not use REAPTAN to treat other complaints unless your doctor tells you to.</strong></li>
<li><strong>do not stop taking REAPTAN or change the dosage, without checking with your doctor.</strong></li>
<li><strong>do not stop taking your tablets because you are feeling better, unless advised by your doctor.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3><em>Things that may help your condition</em></h3>
<p>Some self - help measures suggested below may help your condition. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about these measures and for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol - your doctor may advise you to limit your alcohol intake</li>
<li>Diet - eat a healthy low-fat diet which includes plenty of fresh vegetables, fruit, bread, cereals and fish. Also eat less fat and sugar</li>
<li>Exercise - regular exercise helps to reduce blood pressure and helps get the heart fitter, but it is important not to overdo it. Walking is good exercise, but try to find a route that is reasonably flat. Before starting any exercise, ask your doctor about the best kind of program for you</li>
<li>Salt - your doctor may advise you to watch the amount of salt in your diet. To reduce your salt intake you should avoid using salt in cooking or at the table</li>
<li>Smoking - your doctor may advise you to stop or at least cut down smoking</li>
<li>Weight - your doctor may suggest losing some weight to help lower your blood pressure and help lessen the amount of work your heart has to do. Some people may need a dietician's help to lose weight.</li>
</ul>

Consumer Medicine Information
WHAT IS IN THIS LEAFLET
This leaflet answers some common questions about REAPTAN.
It does not contain all the available information about this medicine.
Reading this leaflet does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.
All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking REAPTAN against the benefits they expect it will have for you.
If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Keep this leaflet with the medicine.
You may need to read it again.
WHAT REAPTAN IS
The name of your medicine is REAPTAN.
The medicine contains the active ingredient perindopril arginine. Perindopril belongs to a group of medicines called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.
It also contains the active ingredient amlodipine besilate. Amlodipine belongs to a group of medicines called calcium channel blockers.
Calcium channel blockers do not change the amount of calcium in your blood or bones.
REAPTAN has been prescribed for you by your doctor to replace the separate tablets of perindopril and amlodipine you were taking.
One REAPTAN tablet replaces separate tablets of perindopril and amlodipine.
WHAT REAPTAN IS USED FOR
You have been prescribed REAPTAN if you have high blood pressure, also known as hypertension.
Why REAPTAN is used for high blood pressure
Everyone has blood pressure. This pressure helps get your blood all around the body. Your blood pressure may be different at different times of the day, depending on how busy or stressed you are.
You have high blood pressure when your blood pressure stays higher than is needed, even when you are calm or relaxed.
There are usually no symptoms of high blood pressure. The only way of knowing that you have it is to have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. If high blood pressure is not treated it can lead to serious health problems. You may feel fine and have no symptoms, but eventually it can cause stroke, heart disease and kidney failure.
The active ingredients in REAPTAN, perindopril arginine and amlodipine help lower your blood pressure.
You may also have been prescribed REAPTAN if you have coronary heart disease.
Why REAPTAN is used for coronary heart disease
Coronary heart disease is narrowing of the vessels carrying blood to the heart.
In patients with coronary artery disease, REAPTAN has been shown to reduce some of the risks, including heart attacks.
HOW REAPTAN WORKS
REAPTAN works by widening your blood vessels, which reduces pressure in the vessel, making it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body
This helps increase the supply of oxygen to your heart, so that when you place extra demands on your heart, such as during exercise, your heart may cope better and you may not get short of breath as easily.
Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why REAPTAN has been prescribed for you.
REAPTAN is available only with a doctor's prescription.
There is no evidence that REAPTAN is addictive.
BEFORE YOU TAKE REAPTAN
There are some people who shouldn't take REAPTAN. Please read the list below.
If you think any of these situations apply to you or you have any questions, please consult your doctor or pharmacist.
Do not take REAPTAN if:

you are allergic to perindopril or amlodipine, or any of the other ingredients of REAPTAN listed at the end of this leaflet
you have had an allergic reaction to any other ACE inhibitors or calcium channel blockers 
Symptoms of an allergic reaction to REAPTAN may include skin rash, itchiness, shortness of breath, swelling of the face, lips or tongue, muscle pain or tenderness or joint pain
are pregnant or trying to become pregnant 
REAPTAN may affect your developing baby if you take it during pregnancy.
are breastfeeding or plan to breast-feed 
REAPTAN passes into breast milk and therefore there is a possibility that the breast-fed baby may be affected.
are undergoing treatments where your blood is treated outside of the body (also known as extracorporeal treatments) that may increase your risk of allergic reactions, treatments such as:
- renal dialysis or haemofiltration using polyacrylonitrile membranes
- low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis, a technique where LDL is 'filtered' out of the blood, using dextran sulphate.
you are treated with a blood pressure lowering medicine containing aliskiren and have diabetes or impaired kidney function
have renal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels to one or both kidneys)
have aortic stenosis (narrowing of the main blood vessel leaving from the heart)
have severe hypotension (low blood pressure)
have unstable angina. 
Unstable angina is a pain or uncomfortable feeling in the chest that lasts longer than a few minutes or occurs with rest, and may not be relieved with medication
have cardiogenic shock which is a sudden and severe drop in blood pressure and blood flow through the body because the heart is not pumping normally
have heart failure during the first 28 days after a heart attack (Heart failure means that the heart muscle cannot pump blood strongly enough to supply all the blood needed throughout the body. It does not mean that the heart stops working)
have experienced swelling of the face, tongue, lips or throat either spontaneously or in response to another medicine in the past. (This rare condition is known as angio-oedema)
the packaging is damaged or shows sign of tampering
the expiry date (EXP) on the pack has passed.

If you think any of these situations apply to you, or you have any doubts or questions about taking REAPTAN speak to your doctor or pharmacist.
For older people and patients with renal impairment
REAPTAN can generally be used safely by elderly people.
Reduced kidney function is often found in elderly people and in this case, the starting dose should always be 2.5 mg of perindopril arginine and 2.5 mg of amlodipine taken as separate tablets.
For children
REAPTAN is not recommended for children.
Driving and using machines
REAPTAN may affect your ability to drive or use machines. If the tablets make you feel sick, dizzy, weak or tired, or give you a headache, do not drive or use machines and contact your doctor immediately.

you have recently suffered from diarrhoea or vomiting.
you are on a salt restricted diet or use salt substitutes which contain potassium.
you have an intolerance to some sugars as REAPTAN contains lactose.
you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:
- an 'angiotensin II receptor blocker' (also known as ARBs or sartans - for example valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan), in particular if you have diabetes-related kidney problems
- aliskiren.

HOW TO TAKE REAPTAN
Follow all directions given to you by your doctor and pharmacist carefully. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.
If you do not understand the instructions on the label, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.
How much to take
Your doctor will select a dose when they prescribe REAPTAN for you. The usual dose is one tablet once daily.
How to take it
Swallow your tablet(s) with a glass of water.
Grapefruit juice and grapefruit should not be consumed by people who are taking REAPTAN. This is because grapefruit and grapefruit juice can lead to an increase in the blood levels of the active ingredient amlodipine, which can cause an unpredictable increase in the blood pressure lowering effect of REAPTAN.
When to take it
Take REAPTAN at about the same time each day unless your doctor tells you otherwise.
Taking your tablet at the same time each day will have the best effect. It will also help you remember when to take the tablets.
REAPTAN should be taken in the morning before a meal. If you forget to take it
If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to. Otherwise, take it as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking it as you would normally.
Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed.
How long to take it for
REAPTAN helps control your blood pressure and/or treat your coronary heart disease but does not cure it. Continue taking the tablets for as long as your doctor tells you.
If you take too much
Immediately telephone your doctor, or the Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26 in Australia) if you think you or anyone else may have taken too much REAPTAN. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.
WHILE YOU ARE TAKING REAPTAN
Things you must do

If you are about to be started on any new medicine, remind your doctor and pharmacist that you are taking REAPTAN.

Consumer Medicine Information
What is in this leaflet
This leaflet answers some common questions about Eltroxin tablets.
It does not contain all the available information about the medicine.
It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.
All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking Eltroxin against the benefits he or she expects it will have.
If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Keep this leaflet with the medicine. You may need to read it again.
The name of your medicine is Eltroxin. It is available in tablets of six different strengths: 25 micrograms (scored), 50 micrograms, 75 micrograms, 100 micrograms, 125 micrograms and 200 micrograms.
The active ingredient is called levothyroxine sodium.
What is it used for
Levothyroxine sodium is a thyroid hormone. It is used as replacement therapy in the treatment of thyroid hormone deficiency.
Eltroxin is used to treat:

Thyroid hormone deficiency also known as Hypothyroidism.
Hypothyroidism is a disease in which the thyroid gland is underactive and does not produce enough levothyroxine, a hormone, which is important for controlling your metabolism. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include tiredness, muscle weakness, and cramps, feeling the cold, a slow heart rate, dry and flaky skin, hair loss, a deep husky voice and weight gain.
TSH-responsive tumours (certain tumours of the thyroid gland) of the thyroid
For these conditions to be treated, patients need a supply of thyroid hormones in their body. Eltroxin replaces the shortage of thyroid hormones.

Use Eltroxin only as directed. Your doctor may have prescribed Eltroxin for another condition.
Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why the medicine has been prescribed for you.
Ask your doctor if you have any concerns about taking it.
Eltroxin tablets are only available with a doctor’s prescription.

<p><strong>Consumer Medicine Information</strong></p>
<h2>What is in this leaflet</h2>
<p>This leaflet answers some common questions about SEVIKAR HCT. It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking SEVIKAR HCT against the benefits they expect it will have for you.</p>
<p><strong>If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keep this leaflet with the medicine.</strong> You may need to read it again.</p>
<h2>What SEVIKAR HCT is used for</h2>
<p>SEVIKAR HCT is used to treat high blood pressure which is sometimes called hypertension.</p>
<p>Everyone has blood pressure. This pressure helps push blood all around your body. Your blood pressure changes at different times of the day, depending on how busy or worried you are. You have hypertension (high blood pressure) when your blood pressure stays higher than is needed, even when you are calm and relaxed.</p>
<p>There are usually no symptoms of hypertension. The only way of knowing that you have hypertension is to have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. If high blood pressure is not treated it can lead to serious health problems, including stroke, heart disease and kidney failure.</p>
<h3><em>How SEVIKAR HCT works</em></h3>
<p>SEVIKAR HCT contains olmesartan medoxomil, which belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Angiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body which causes blood vessels to tighten. SEVIKAR HCT blocks the action of angiotensin-II and therefore relaxes your blood vessels. This helps lower your blood pressure.</p>
<p>SEVIKAR HCT also contains amlodipine besilate, a calcium channel blocker. This reduces the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. This also helps to lower blood pressure as it relaxes the blood vessels and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.</p>
<p>SEVIKAR HCT also contains hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic which reduces the amount of fluid in the body. This also helps to lower blood pressure.</p>
<p>Your doctor may have prescribed SEVIKAR HCT for another reason. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why SEVIKAR HCT has been prescribed for you.</p>
<p>This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription.</p>
<p>The safety and effectiveness of SEVIKAR HCT in children and teenagers under the age of 18 years have not been established.</p>
<p>SEVIKAR HCT is not addictive.</p>

<h2>How to take SEVIKAR HCT</h2>
<p><strong>Follow all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist carefully.</strong> They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will tell you which SEVIKAR HCT tablet you will need to take each day. This depends on your condition and whether or not you are taking any other medicines.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not understand the instructions on the box, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How much to take</em></h3>
<p>The dose of SEVIKAR HCT is one tablet to be taken once a day.</p>
<h3><em>How to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Swallow SEVIKAR HCT whole with a full glass of water.</strong></p>
<p>Do not chew the tablets.</p>
<h3><em>When to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Take SEVIKAR HCT at about the same time each day, with or without food.</strong> Taking your tablets at the same time each day will have the best effect. It will also help you remember when to take the tablets. It does not matter whether you take it with or without food.</p>

<h3><em>If you forget to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Otherwise, take it as soon as you remember and then go back to taking your medicine as you would normally.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed.</strong> This may increase the chance of you getting an unwanted side effect.</p>
<p><strong>If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints.</strong></p>
<h3><em>If you take too much (overdose)</em></h3>
<p><strong>Immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26) or go to Accident and Emergency at the nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much SEVIKAR HCT. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keep telephone numbers for these places handy.</strong></p>
<p>If you take too much SEVIKAR HCT, you may feel light-headed, dizzy or you may faint. You may also have nausea, drowsiness, muscle spasm and a fast heartbeat.</p>
<h2>While you are using SEVIKAR HCT</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p><strong>If you are about to be started on any new medicine, tell your doctor, dentist or pharmacist that you are taking SEVIKAR HCT.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Make sure you drink enough water during exercise and hot weather when you are taking SEVIKAR HCT, especially if you sweat a lot.</strong> If you do not drink enough water while taking SEVIKAR HCT, you may feel light-headed or sick. This is because your blood pressure is dropping suddenly. If you continue to feel unwell, tell your doctor.</p>
<p><strong>If you have excess vomiting and/or diarrhoea while taking SEVIKAR HCT, tell your doctor.</strong> You may lose too much water and salt and your blood pressure may drop too much. You may also have dry mouth, weakness, drowsiness, confusion, muscle pain or cramps and seizures. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>If you feel light-headed or dizzy after taking your first dose of SEVIKAR HCT, or when your dose is increased, tell your doctor immediately.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you plan to have surgery that needs a general anaesthetic, tell your doctor or dentist that you are taking SEVIKAR HCT.</strong> Your blood pressure may drop suddenly.</p>
<p><strong>If you become pregnant while taking SEVIKAR HCT, tell your doctor immediately.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are about to have any blood tests, tell your doctor that you are taking SEVIKAR HCT.</strong> SEVIKAR HCT may interfere with the results of some tests.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if photosensitivity reaction occurs during your treatment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor immediately in case of acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Have your blood pressure checked when your doctor says, to make sure SEVIKAR HCT is working.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Go to your doctor regularly for a check-up. Your doctor may occasionally do a blood test to check your potassium levels and see how your kidneys are working.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not give SEVIKAR HCT to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not take SEVIKAR HCT to treat any other complaints unless your doctor or pharmacist tells you to.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not stop taking SEVIKAR HCT, or lower the dosage, without checking with your doctor.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things to be careful of</em></h3>
<p><strong>If you feel light-headed, dizzy or faint when getting out of bed or standing up, get up slowly.</strong> Standing up slowly, especially when you get up from bed or chairs, will help your body get used to the change in position and blood pressure. If this problem continues or gets worse, talk to your doctor.</p>
<p><strong>Be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how SEVIKAR HCT affects you.</strong> As with other medicines in this class, SEVIKAR HCT may cause dizziness, light-headedness or tiredness in some people. Make sure you know how you react to SEVIKAR HCT before you drive a car, operate machinery, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or light-headed. If this occurs do not drive. If you drink alcohol, dizziness or light-headedness may be worse.</p>
<h3><em>Things that would be helpful for your blood pressure</em></h3>
<p>Some self-help measures suggested below may help your condition. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about these measures and for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol - your doctor may advise you to limit your alcohol intake.</li>
<li>Weight - your doctor may suggest losing some weight to help lower your blood pressure and help lessen the amount of work your heart has to do. Some people may need a dietician's help to lose weight.</li>
<li>Diet - eat a healthy diet which includes plenty of fresh vegetables, fruit, bread (preferably wholegrain), cereals and fish. Also eat less sugar and fat (especially saturated fat) which includes sausages, fatty meats, full cream dairy products, biscuits, cakes, pastries, chocolates, chips and coconut. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats from olive oil, canola oil, avocado and nuts are beneficial in small quantities.</li>
<li>Salt - your doctor may advise you to watch the amount of salt in your diet. To reduce your salt intake you should avoid using salt in cooking or at the table and avoid cooked or processed foods containing high sodium (salt) levels.</li>
<li>Exercise - regular exercise, maintained over the long term, helps to reduce blood pressure and helps get the heart fitter. Regular exercise also improves your blood cholesterol levels, helps reduce your weight and stress levels, and improves your sleep, mood and ability to concentrate. However, it is important not to overdo it. Walking is good exercise, but try to find a route that is reasonably flat. Before starting any exercise, ask your doctor about the best kind of programme for you.</li>
<li>Smoking - your doctor may advise you to stop smoking or at least cut down. There are enormous benefits to be gained from giving up smoking. There are many professionals, organisations and strategies to help you quit. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for further information and advice.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Side effects</h2>

<p>SEVIKAR HCT helps most people with high blood pressure, but it may have unwanted side effects in a few people. All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical treatment if you get some of the side effects.</p>

Consumer Medicine Information
What is in this leaflet
This leaflet answers some common questions about SEVIKAR HCT. It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.
All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking SEVIKAR HCT against the benefits they expect it will have for you.
If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Keep this leaflet with the medicine. You may need to read it again.
What SEVIKAR HCT is used for
SEVIKAR HCT is used to treat high blood pressure which is sometimes called hypertension.
Everyone has blood pressure. This pressure helps push blood all around your body. Your blood pressure changes at different times of the day, depending on how busy or worried you are. You have hypertension (high blood pressure) when your blood pressure stays higher than is needed, even when you are calm and relaxed.
There are usually no symptoms of hypertension. The only way of knowing that you have hypertension is to have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. If high blood pressure is not treated it can lead to serious health problems, including stroke, heart disease and kidney failure.
How SEVIKAR HCT works
SEVIKAR HCT contains olmesartan medoxomil, which belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Angiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body which causes blood vessels to tighten. SEVIKAR HCT blocks the action of angiotensin-II and therefore relaxes your blood vessels. This helps lower your blood pressure.
SEVIKAR HCT also contains amlodipine besilate, a calcium channel blocker. This reduces the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. This also helps to lower blood pressure as it relaxes the blood vessels and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.
SEVIKAR HCT also contains hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic which reduces the amount of fluid in the body. This also helps to lower blood pressure.
Your doctor may have prescribed SEVIKAR HCT for another reason. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why SEVIKAR HCT has been prescribed for you.
This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription.
The safety and effectiveness of SEVIKAR HCT in children and teenagers under the age of 18 years have not been established.
SEVIKAR HCT is not addictive.

Use in children
The safety and effectiveness of SEVIKAR HCT in children have not been established.
How to take SEVIKAR HCT
Follow all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist carefully. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.
Your doctor or pharmacist will tell you which SEVIKAR HCT tablet you will need to take each day. This depends on your condition and whether or not you are taking any other medicines.
If you do not understand the instructions on the box, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.
How much to take
The dose of SEVIKAR HCT is one tablet to be taken once a day.
How to take it
Swallow SEVIKAR HCT whole with a full glass of water.
Do not chew the tablets.
When to take it
Take SEVIKAR HCT at about the same time each day, with or without food. Taking your tablets at the same time each day will have the best effect. It will also help you remember when to take the tablets. It does not matter whether you take it with or without food.
How long to take it
SEVIKAR HCT helps control your condition, but does not cure it. Therefore you must take SEVIKAR HCT every day. Continue taking your medicine for as long as your doctor tells you.
If you forget to take it
If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to.
Otherwise, take it as soon as you remember and then go back to taking your medicine as you would normally.
Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed. This may increase the chance of you getting an unwanted side effect.
If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints.
If you take too much (overdose)
Immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26) or go to Accident and Emergency at the nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much SEVIKAR HCT. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.
Keep telephone numbers for these places handy.
If you take too much SEVIKAR HCT, you may feel light-headed, dizzy or you may faint. You may also have nausea, drowsiness, muscle spasm and a fast heartbeat.
While you are using SEVIKAR HCT
Things you must do
If you are about to be started on any new medicine, tell your doctor, dentist or pharmacist that you are taking SEVIKAR HCT.
Make sure you drink enough water during exercise and hot weather when you are taking SEVIKAR HCT, especially if you sweat a lot. If you do not drink enough water while taking SEVIKAR HCT, you may feel light-headed or sick. This is because your blood pressure is dropping suddenly. If you continue to feel unwell, tell your doctor.
If you have excess vomiting and/or diarrhoea while taking SEVIKAR HCT, tell your doctor. You may lose too much water and salt and your blood pressure may drop too much. You may also have dry mouth, weakness, drowsiness, confusion, muscle pain or cramps and seizures. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms.
If you feel light-headed or dizzy after taking your first dose of SEVIKAR HCT, or when your dose is increased, tell your doctor immediately.
If you plan to have surgery that needs a general anaesthetic, tell your doctor or dentist that you are taking SEVIKAR HCT. Your blood pressure may drop suddenly.
If you become pregnant while taking SEVIKAR HCT, tell your doctor immediately.
If you are about to have any blood tests, tell your doctor that you are taking SEVIKAR HCT. SEVIKAR HCT may interfere with the results of some tests.
Tell your doctor if photosensitivity reaction occurs during your treatment.
Tell your doctor immediately in case of acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain.
Have your blood pressure checked when your doctor says, to make sure SEVIKAR HCT is working.
Go to your doctor regularly for a check-up. Your doctor may occasionally do a blood test to check your potassium levels and see how your kidneys are working.
Things you must not do
Do not give SEVIKAR HCT to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.
Do not take SEVIKAR HCT to treat any other complaints unless your doctor or pharmacist tells you to.
Do not stop taking SEVIKAR HCT, or lower the dosage, without checking with your doctor.
Things to be careful of
If you feel light-headed, dizzy or faint when getting out of bed or standing up, get up slowly. Standing up slowly, especially when you get up from bed or chairs, will help your body get used to the change in position and blood pressure. If this problem continues or gets worse, talk to your doctor.
Be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how SEVIKAR HCT affects you. As with other medicines in this class, SEVIKAR HCT may cause dizziness, light-headedness or tiredness in some people. Make sure you know how you react to SEVIKAR HCT before you drive a car, operate machinery, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or light-headed. If this occurs do not drive. If you drink alcohol, dizziness or light-headedness may be worse.
Things that would be helpful for your blood pressure
Some self-help measures suggested below may help your condition. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about these measures and for more information.

Alcohol - your doctor may advise you to limit your alcohol intake.
Weight - your doctor may suggest losing some weight to help lower your blood pressure and help lessen the amount of work your heart has to do. Some people may need a dietician's help to lose weight.
Diet - eat a healthy diet which includes plenty of fresh vegetables, fruit, bread (preferably wholegrain), cereals and fish. Also eat less sugar and fat (especially saturated fat) which includes sausages, fatty meats, full cream dairy products, biscuits, cakes, pastries, chocolates, chips and coconut. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats from olive oil, canola oil, avocado and nuts are beneficial in small quantities.
Salt - your doctor may advise you to watch the amount of salt in your diet. To reduce your salt intake you should avoid using salt in cooking or at the table and avoid cooked or processed foods containing high sodium (salt) levels.
Exercise - regular exercise, maintained over the long term, helps to reduce blood pressure and helps get the heart fitter. Regular exercise also improves your blood cholesterol levels, helps reduce your weight and stress levels, and improves your sleep, mood and ability to concentrate. However, it is important not to overdo it. Walking is good exercise, but try to find a route that is reasonably flat. Before starting any exercise, ask your doctor about the best kind of programme for you.
Smoking - your doctor may advise you to stop smoking or at least cut down. There are enormous benefits to be gained from giving up smoking. There are many professionals, organisations and strategies to help you quit. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for further information and advice.

Side effects
Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking SEVIKAR HCT.
SEVIKAR HCT helps most people with high blood pressure, but it may have unwanted side effects in a few people. All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical treatment if you get some of the side effects.
If you are over 65 years of age you may have an increased chance of getting side effects.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.

swelling of the face, hands, feet or ankles
symptoms that may indicate high potassium levels in the blood, such as nausea, diarrhoea, muscle weakness, change in heart rhythm
symptoms that may indicate water and salt imbalance such as dry mouth, weakness, drowsiness, confusion, muscle pain or cramps and seizures.

These may be serious side effects. You may need medical attention. Serious side effects are rare.
If any of the following happen, stop taking SEVIKAR HCT and either tell your doctor immediately or go to Accident and Emergency at your nearest hospital:

swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat which may cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing
chest pain

These are very serious side effects. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation. These side effects are very rare.

<p><strong>Consumer Medicine Information</strong></p>
<h2>What is in this leaflet</h2>
<p><strong>Please read this leaflet before you start taking MEZAVANT.</strong></p>
<p>This leaflet answers some common questions about MEZAVANT.</p>
<p>It does not contain all available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risk of you using MEZAVANT against the benefit it is expected to have for you.</p>
<p><strong>If you have any concerns about taking MEZAVANT, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>

<h2>What MEZAVANT is used for</h2>
<p>The name of your medicine is MEZAVANT 1.2g, gastro-resistant, prolonged release tablets. It contains the active ingredient mesalazine (also called 5-aminosalicylic acid or 5-ASA), an anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.</p>
<p>Ulcerative colitis is a disease of the large intestine (the colon and rectum), where the lining of the intestine becomes red and swollen (inflamed) and ulcers develop. This can cause symptoms of frequent and bloody stools together with stomach cramps.</p>
<p>When MEZAVANT is taken for a flare up of ulcerative colitis, it acts through the entire colon and rectum to treat the inflammation and reduce symptoms. MEZAVANT can also be taken to help prevent re-occurrence of ulcerative colitis.</p>
<h2>Before you take MEZAVANT</h2>

Consumer Medicine Information
What is in this leaflet
Please read this leaflet before you start taking MEZAVANT.
This leaflet answers some common questions about MEZAVANT.
It does not contain all available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.
All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risk of you using MEZAVANT against the benefit it is expected to have for you.
If you have any concerns about taking MEZAVANT, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
Keep this leaflet with the medicine. You may want to read it again.
What MEZAVANT is used for
The name of your medicine is MEZAVANT 1.2g, gastro-resistant, prolonged release tablets. It contains the active ingredient mesalazine (also called 5-aminosalicylic acid or 5-ASA), an anti-inflammatory drug for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
Ulcerative colitis is a disease of the large intestine (the colon and rectum), where the lining of the intestine becomes red and swollen (inflamed) and ulcers develop. This can cause symptoms of frequent and bloody stools together with stomach cramps.
When MEZAVANT is taken for a flare up of ulcerative colitis, it acts through the entire colon and rectum to treat the inflammation and reduce symptoms. MEZAVANT can also be taken to help prevent re-occurrence of ulcerative colitis.
Before you take MEZAVANT
MEZAVANT 1.2g gastro-resistant, prolonged release tablets are not suitable for everyone.
When you must not take it
Do not take MEZAVANT:

If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to a family of drugs known as salicylates (which include aspirin).
If you are allergic (hypersensitive) to mesalazine or any of the other ingredients of MEZAVANT listed in ""Other ingredients"" section of this leaflet.
The expiry date printed on the carton is passed. If you use this medication after the expiry date has passed, it may not work as well.
The packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering.

If you are not sure whether you should start using MEZAVANT, contact your doctor.
Before you take it
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you:

Have any kidney problems
Have previously had inflammation of the heart (which may be the result of an infection in the heart)
Have had a previous allergic reaction to MEZAVANT or other medicines containing mesalazine or sulphasalazine (other medicines taken for treatment of ulcerative colitis)
Have narrowing or blockage of the stomach or the gut
Have skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis or atopic eczema
Are pregnant or intend to become pregnant
Are breastfeeding or wish to breastfeed.

If you have not told your doctor or pharmacist about any of the above, tell them before you take any MEZAVANT.

Mesalazine or sulphasalazine (taken for treatment of ulcerative colitis)

Azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine (known as 'immunosuppressant' medicines).

Consumer Medicine Information
What is in this leaflet
This leaflet answers some common questions about Eltroxin tablets.
It does not contain all the available information about the medicine.
It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.
All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking Eltroxin against the benefits he or she expects it will have.
If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Keep this leaflet with the medicine. You may need to read it again.
The name of your medicine is Eltroxin. It is available in tablets of six different strengths: 25 micrograms (scored), 50 micrograms, 75 micrograms, 100 micrograms, 125 micrograms and 200 micrograms.
The active ingredient is called levothyroxine sodium.
What is it used for
Levothyroxine sodium is a thyroid hormone. It is used as replacement therapy in the treatment of thyroid hormone deficiency.
Eltroxin is used to treat:

Thyroid hormone deficiency also known as Hypothyroidism.
Hypothyroidism is a disease in which the thyroid gland is underactive and does not produce enough levothyroxine, a hormone, which is important for controlling your metabolism. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include tiredness, muscle weakness, and cramps, feeling the cold, a slow heart rate, dry and flaky skin, hair loss, a deep husky voice and weight gain.
TSH-responsive tumours (certain tumours of the thyroid gland) of the thyroid
For these conditions to be treated, patients need a supply of thyroid hormones in their body. Eltroxin replaces the shortage of thyroid hormones.

Use Eltroxin only as directed. Your doctor may have prescribed Eltroxin for another condition.
Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why the medicine has been prescribed for you.
Ask your doctor if you have any concerns about taking it.
Eltroxin tablets are only available with a doctor’s prescription.
Before you take it
When you must not take it
Do not take Eltroxin if you are allergic to:

Levothyroxine sodium or any other thyroid hormone (eg. Tertroxin)

Before you start to take it
Tell your doctor if:

Ask your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking Eltroxin during pregnancy.
You are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed.
Although small amounts of Eltroxin are found in breast milk, women who are breastfeeding should continue treatment with Eltroxin.

<p><strong>Consumer Medicine Information</strong></p>
<h2>What is in this leaflet</h2>
<p>This leaflet answers some common questions about Clexane.</p>
<p>It does not contain all the available information.</p>
<p>It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you using Clexane against the benefits they expect it will have for you.</p>

<p>Keep this leaflet with the medicine.</p>
<p>You may need to read it again.</p>
<h2>What Clexane is used for</h2>
<p>Clexane is used in a number of medical conditions. It is used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>treat blood clots</li>
<li>treat certain types of heart disease (eg. angina and heart attacks), when used with aspirin</li>
<li>prevent blood clots forming after an operation, during hospitalisation or extended bed rest or during purification of the blood by an artificial kidney (haemodialysis).</li>
</ul>
<p>Clexane is one of a group of medicines called low molecular weight heparins (LMWH). These medicines work by reducing blood clotting activity.</p>
<p>Your doctor may have prescribed Clexane for another reason.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why Clexane has been prescribed for you.</strong></p>
<p>There is no evidence that Clexane is addictive.</p>
<p>This medicine is only available with a doctor's prescription.</p>
<h2>Before you are given it</h2>
<h3><em>When you must not use it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not use Clexane if you have an allergy to Clexane, heparin or its derivatives including other LMWHs. Some signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction can include swelling of the face, lips or tongue, wheezing or troubled breathing, skin rash, itching hives, blisters or peeling skin.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not use Clexane if you have, or have ever had any of the following medical conditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>major blood disorders</li>
<li>certain types of stroke</li>
<li>stomach or bowel problems such as ulcers or ulcerative colitis</li>
<li>bacterial infections in your heart.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do not give Clexane to a child.</strong> The safety and effectiveness of Clexane has not been established in children.</p>
<p><strong>Do not use Clexane after the expiry date printed on the syringe.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not use Clexane if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are not sure whether you should start using Clexane, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Before you are given it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have allergies to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>heparin or its derivatives, including other LMWHs</li>
<li>any other medicines</li>
<li>any other substances, such as foods, preservatives or dyes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have or have had any of the following medical conditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>major bleeding disorder or blood clotting problem, including a recent stroke or hereditary blood disorders</li>
<li>bacterial endocarditis, inflammation of the lining of the heart caused by bacteria</li>
<li>stomach or bowel problems such as ulcers or ulcerative colitis</li>
<li>kidney or liver disease</li>
<li>uncontrolled high blood pressure</li>
<li>diabetic related eye disease</li>
<li>recently undergone brain, spinal or eye surgery</li>
<li>history of spinal surgery or spinal deformity</li>
<li>an artificial heart valve</li>
<li>obesity</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have not told your doctor or pharmacist about any of the above, tell them before you start using Clexane.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant.</strong> Like most LMWHs, Clexane is not recommended to be used during pregnancy. If there is a need to consider Clexane during your pregnancy, your doctor or pharmacist will discuss with you the benefits and risks of using it.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.</strong> Like most LMWHs, Clexane is not recommended while you are breastfeeding. If there is a need to consider Clexane while you are breastfeeding, your doctor or pharmacist will discuss with you the benefits and risks of using it.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor that you are using Clexane if your doctor is planning for you to have an anaesthetic injection in your back (spinal or epidural injection).</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have not told your doctor or pharmacist about any of the above, tell them before you start using Clexane.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Taking other medicines</em></h3>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, including any that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.</strong></p>
<p>Some medicines and Clexane may interfere with each other. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>medicines or substances used to prevent and treat blood clots</li>
<li>medicines containing aspirin or salicylates</li>
<li>Dextran 40, a medicine use to treat shock</li>
<li>medicines used to treat inflammatory disease, such as oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines or corticosteroids.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these medicines are used while using Clexane, careful monitoring of your blood clotting factors is required by your doctor.</p>
<p>These medicines may be affected by Clexane or may affect how well it works. You may need to use different amounts of your medicine or you may need to use different medicines. Your doctor or pharmacist will advise you.</p>
<p>Your doctor and pharmacist may have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while using Clexane.</p>
<h2>How to use it</h2>
<h3><em>How much to use</em></h3>
<p><strong>Your doctor will decide what dose you will receive. This depends on your condition and other factors, such as your weight.</strong></p>
<p>For the prevention of blood clots, the following are the usual doses, which are administered by injection under the skin once a day:</p>
<ul>
<li>moderate risk patients: 20mg</li>
<li>high risk patients: 40mg</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For the treatment of blood clots which have formed in the leg/deep vein,</strong> <br>
the usual dose is 1mg/kg body weight twice a day or 1.5mg/kg body weight once a day injected under the skin. Warfarin sodium therapy is usually started within 72 hours of Clexane by your doctor.</br></p>
<p><strong>For patients that require dialysis,</strong> <br>
the usual dose is 1mg/kg into the tubing of the dialysis machine at the start of the session. Additional doses may be given if required.</br></p>
<p><strong>For treatment of severe heart attacks,</strong> <br/>
the usual dose is 30mg injected into a vein plus 1mg/kg injected under the skin, followed by 1mg/kg injected under the skin twice a day.</p>
<p><strong>For treatment of certain other types of heart disease,</strong> <br/>
the usual dose is 1 mg/kg injected under the skin twice a day.</p>
<p>These doses of Clexane may be changed by your doctor. Your doctor will decide when and how much Clexane you will be given.</p>
<h3><em>How to use it</em></h3>
<p>Clexane is usually given by an injection under the skin or into the tubing of the dialysis machine. The recommended site for injection is the stomach area. A different injection site should be used for each injection. Do not rub the injection site after administration.</p>
<p>It may be given by your doctor, nurse or yourself. Your doctor will tell you how you will be given your injection.</p>
<p>Clexane can also be given by an injection into a vein. This will be done in hospital by your doctor or nurse.</p>
<p><strong>Prefilled Syringes</strong> <br/>
The prefilled syringes are ready for use. The air bubble in the syringe should not be expelled.</p>
<p><strong>Graduated Prefilled Syringes</strong> <br/>
When using the 60mg, 80mg, 100mg, 120mg and 150mg graduated syringes, the volume to be injected should be measured precisely according to the dosage recommended by your doctor.</p>
<p><strong>Injection Technique</strong> <br/>
The whole length of the syringe needle should be introduced vertically into the thickness of a skin fold gently held between the operator's thumb and finger. This skin fold should be held throughout the duration of the injection.</p>
<p>Clexane does not contain any antimicrobial agents, so must be used once only and any residue discarded.</p>
<h3><em>How long to use it</em></h3>
<p>Your doctor will tell you how long you will be using Clexane.</p>
<h3><em>If you use too much (overdose)</em></h3>
<p><strong>As Clexane is often given to you under the supervision of your doctor, it is very unlikely that you will receive too much. However, some patients may self-inject Clexane.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or nurse or telephone the Poisons Information Centre in Australia (13 11 26) or the National Poisons Information Centre in NZ (0800 POISON or 0800 764 766), or go to Accident and Emergency at your nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have injected too much Clexane.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.</strong> You may need urgent medical attention.</p>
<h2>While you are using it</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Use Clexane exactly as your doctor has prescribed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you become pregnant while using Clexane tell your doctor immediately.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you have an artificial heart valve.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are about to be started on any new medicine tell your doctor, dentist or pharmacist that you are using Clexane.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell any other doctors, dentists or pharmacists who are treating you that you are using Clexane.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you plan to have surgery, tell your doctor or dentist that you are using Clexane.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor that you are using Clexane if your doctor is planning for you to have an anaesthetic injection in your back (spinal or epidural injection).</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not give Clexane to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not use Clexane to treat any other complaints, unless your doctor tells you to.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not stop using Clexane, or lower the dosage, without checking with your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not mix Clexane with other injections or infusion fluids.</strong> Certain medicines or solutions contain ingredients that can interact with Clexane. If you need an injection of Clexane into a vein, your doctor or nurse will make sure it is not mixed with any medicines or solutions with which it can interact.</p>
<p><strong>Do not inject Clexane into a muscle.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things to be careful of</em></h3>
<p><strong>Clexane is not interchangeable with other low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) products.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor whether there are any activities you should avoid while using Clexane, for example certain sports.</strong> Sometimes after an injury bleeding may occur inside your body without you knowing about it.</p>
<p>Be sure to keep all of your doctor appointments. Your doctor will check your progress and may want to take some blood tests from time to time.</p>
<h2>Side Effects</h2>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are using Clexane.</strong></p>
<p>All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical treatment if you get some of the side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you notice any of the following and they worry you:</strong></p>

Consumer Medicine Information
What is in this leaflet
This leaflet answers some common questions about Clexane.
It does not contain all the available information.
It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.
All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you using Clexane against the benefits they expect it will have for you.
If you have any concerns about using this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Keep this leaflet with the medicine.
You may need to read it again.
What Clexane is used for
Clexane is used in a number of medical conditions. It is used to:

treat blood clots
treat certain types of heart disease (eg. angina and heart attacks), when used with aspirin
prevent blood clots forming after an operation, during hospitalisation or extended bed rest or during purification of the blood by an artificial kidney (haemodialysis).

Clexane is one of a group of medicines called low molecular weight heparins (LMWH). These medicines work by reducing blood clotting activity.
Your doctor may have prescribed Clexane for another reason.
Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why Clexane has been prescribed for you.
There is no evidence that Clexane is addictive.
This medicine is only available with a doctor's prescription.
Before you are given it
When you must not use it
Do not use Clexane if you have an allergy to Clexane, heparin or its derivatives including other LMWHs. Some signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction can include swelling of the face, lips or tongue, wheezing or troubled breathing, skin rash, itching hives, blisters or peeling skin.
Do not use Clexane if you have, or have ever had any of the following medical conditions:

major blood disorders
certain types of stroke
stomach or bowel problems such as ulcers or ulcerative colitis
bacterial infections in your heart.

Do not give Clexane to a child. The safety and effectiveness of Clexane has not been established in children.
Do not use Clexane after the expiry date printed on the syringe.
Do not use Clexane if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering.
If you are not sure whether you should start using Clexane, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
Before you are given it
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have allergies to:

heparin or its derivatives, including other LMWHs
any other medicines
any other substances, such as foods, preservatives or dyes.

Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have or have had any of the following medical conditions:

major bleeding disorder or blood clotting problem, including a recent stroke or hereditary blood disorders
bacterial endocarditis, inflammation of the lining of the heart caused by bacteria
stomach or bowel problems such as ulcers or ulcerative colitis
kidney or liver disease
uncontrolled high blood pressure
diabetic related eye disease
recently undergone brain, spinal or eye surgery
history of spinal surgery or spinal deformity
an artificial heart valve
obesity

If you have not told your doctor or pharmacist about any of the above, tell them before you start using Clexane.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Like most LMWHs, Clexane is not recommended to be used during pregnancy. If there is a need to consider Clexane during your pregnancy, your doctor or pharmacist will discuss with you the benefits and risks of using it.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Like most LMWHs, Clexane is not recommended while you are breastfeeding. If there is a need to consider Clexane while you are breastfeeding, your doctor or pharmacist will discuss with you the benefits and risks of using it.
Tell your doctor that you are using Clexane if your doctor is planning for you to have an anaesthetic injection in your back (spinal or epidural injection).
If you have not told your doctor or pharmacist about any of the above, tell them before you start using Clexane.
Taking other medicines
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, including any that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.
Some medicines and Clexane may interfere with each other. These include:

medicines or substances used to prevent and treat blood clots
medicines containing aspirin or salicylates
Dextran 40, a medicine use to treat shock
medicines used to treat inflammatory disease, such as oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines or corticosteroids.

If any of these medicines are used while using Clexane, careful monitoring of your blood clotting factors is required by your doctor.
These medicines may be affected by Clexane or may affect how well it works. You may need to use different amounts of your medicine or you may need to use different medicines. Your doctor or pharmacist will advise you.
Your doctor and pharmacist may have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while using Clexane.
How to use it
How much to use
Your doctor will decide what dose you will receive. This depends on your condition and other factors, such as your weight.
For the prevention of blood clots, the following are the usual doses, which are administered by injection under the skin once a day:

moderate risk patients: 20mg
high risk patients: 40mg

For the treatment of blood clots which have formed in the leg/deep vein, 
the usual dose is 1mg/kg body weight twice a day or 1.5mg/kg body weight once a day injected under the skin. Warfarin sodium therapy is usually started within 72 hours of Clexane by your doctor.
For patients that require dialysis, 
the usual dose is 1mg/kg into the tubing of the dialysis machine at the start of the session. Additional doses may be given if required.
For treatment of severe heart attacks, 
the usual dose is 30mg injected into a vein plus 1mg/kg injected under the skin, followed by 1mg/kg injected under the skin twice a day.
For treatment of certain other types of heart disease, 
the usual dose is 1 mg/kg injected under the skin twice a day.
These doses of Clexane may be changed by your doctor. Your doctor will decide when and how much Clexane you will be given.
How to use it
Clexane is usually given by an injection under the skin or into the tubing of the dialysis machine. The recommended site for injection is the stomach area. A different injection site should be used for each injection. Do not rub the injection site after administration.
It may be given by your doctor, nurse or yourself. Your doctor will tell you how you will be given your injection.
Clexane can also be given by an injection into a vein. This will be done in hospital by your doctor or nurse.
Prefilled Syringes 
The prefilled syringes are ready for use. The air bubble in the syringe should not be expelled.
Graduated Prefilled Syringes 
When using the 60mg, 80mg, 100mg, 120mg and 150mg graduated syringes, the volume to be injected should be measured precisely according to the dosage recommended by your doctor.
Injection Technique 
The whole length of the syringe needle should be introduced vertically into the thickness of a skin fold gently held between the operator's thumb and finger. This skin fold should be held throughout the duration of the injection.
Clexane does not contain any antimicrobial agents, so must be used once only and any residue discarded.
How long to use it
Your doctor will tell you how long you will be using Clexane.
If you use too much (overdose)
As Clexane is often given to you under the supervision of your doctor, it is very unlikely that you will receive too much. However, some patients may self-inject Clexane.
Tell your doctor or nurse or telephone the Poisons Information Centre in Australia (13 11 26) or the National Poisons Information Centre in NZ (0800 POISON or 0800 764 766), or go to Accident and Emergency at your nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have injected too much Clexane.
Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. You may need urgent medical attention.
While you are using it
Things you must do
Use Clexane exactly as your doctor has prescribed.
If you become pregnant while using Clexane tell your doctor immediately.
Tell your doctor if you have an artificial heart valve.
If you are about to be started on any new medicine tell your doctor, dentist or pharmacist that you are using Clexane.
Tell any other doctors, dentists or pharmacists who are treating you that you are using Clexane.
If you plan to have surgery, tell your doctor or dentist that you are using Clexane.
Tell your doctor that you are using Clexane if your doctor is planning for you to have an anaesthetic injection in your back (spinal or epidural injection).
Things you must not do
Do not give Clexane to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.
Do not use Clexane to treat any other complaints, unless your doctor tells you to.
Do not stop using Clexane, or lower the dosage, without checking with your doctor or pharmacist.
Do not mix Clexane with other injections or infusion fluids. Certain medicines or solutions contain ingredients that can interact with Clexane. If you need an injection of Clexane into a vein, your doctor or nurse will make sure it is not mixed with any medicines or solutions with which it can interact.
Do not inject Clexane into a muscle.
Things to be careful of
Clexane is not interchangeable with other low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) products.
Ask your doctor whether there are any activities you should avoid while using Clexane, for example certain sports. Sometimes after an injury bleeding may occur inside your body without you knowing about it.
Be sure to keep all of your doctor appointments. Your doctor will check your progress and may want to take some blood tests from time to time.
Side Effects
Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are using Clexane.
All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical treatment if you get some of the side effects.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.
Tell your doctor if you notice any of the following and they worry you:

Pain, bruising or irritation at the injection site after Clexane has been given
hard inflamed nodules at the injection site
itchy red rash at the injection site
bleeding at the injection site
itchy skin

If any of the following happen, stop using Clexane and tell your doctor immediately or go to the Emergency Department at your nearest hospital:

painful itchy red/purple rash at the injection site
difficulty in breathing, symptoms of hayfever, feeling faint, itching hives, blisters or other symptoms of allergy
bleeding (including nose bleeds or prolonged bleeding from cuts), bruising more easily than normal, red or dark brown urine, red or black bowel motions
numbness (paralysis), problems with coordination, dizziness, tiredness, light-headedness, blurred vision, confusion or difficulty speaking
severe abdominal, chest pain and headache
nausea, diarrhoea, fever
swelling of the hands, ankles or feet
a fine widespread rash, especially noticeable on your mouth or eyes or sudden onset of white or blue colour in fingers or toes suggesting poor blood supply.

If you need to have had an anaesthetic injection in your back (spinal or epidural injection) while taking Clexane, this should be done in a hospital. Tell your doctor immediately if any of the following happen after an anaesthetic injection in your back:

pain in the middle of your back (midline back pain)
numbness and weakness in your legs (sensory and motor deficits)
intestinal problems and problems in passing urine

These are very serious side effects. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation. These side effects are rare.
Other side effects not listed above may occur in some patients. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice anything else that is making you feel unwell.
Do not be alarmed by this list of possible side effects. You may not experience any of them.
After using it
If you have any queries about any aspect of your medicine, or any questions regarding the information in this leaflet, discuss them with your doctor or pharmacist.

Keep Clexane in a cool dry place where the temperature stays below 25°C.
Keep the syringes in the pack until it is time to use them.
Do not freeze Clexane.
Do not leave Clexane in the car.
Keep Clexane away from direct sunlight.
Do not store Clexane or any other medicine in the bathroom, near a sink or stove or on a windowsill. Heat, light and dampness can destroy some medicines.

<p><strong>Consumer Medicine Information</strong></p>
<h2>WHAT IS IN THIS LEAFLET</h2>
<p>This leaflet answers some common questions about Androcur.</p>
<p>It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking Androcur against the benefits they expect it will have for you.</p>
<p><strong>If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keep this leaflet with the medicine.</strong> You may need to read it again.</p>
<h2>WHAT ANDROCUR IS USED FOR</h2>
<p>Androcur is an anti-androgen medicine.</p>
<p>Androgens such as testosterone are natural male sex hormones which are also produced, to a slight extent, in females.</p>
<p><strong>MEN:</strong> <br/>
In men, androgens may help cancer cells to grow in some types of prostate cancer. By blocking these hormones, Androcur may slow or stop the growth of cancer. Androcur may also be used in combination with other medicines or following surgical removal of the testes to treat side effects such as “hot flushes” or “sweats” and to prevent any initial worsening of the disease.</p>
<p>Androcur is also used to reduce abnormal sex drive in men.</p>
<p><strong>WOMEN:</strong> <br/>
In women, androgens may increase hair growth, loss of scalp hair and secretion of oil from the sweat glands. By blocking these hormones, Androcur may slow or stop excessive hairiness, loss of scalp hair, acne, oily skin and dandruff.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you.</strong> Your doctor may have prescribed it for another reason.</p>
<p>This medicine is available only with a doctor’s prescription.</p>
<h2>BEFORE YOU TAKE ANDROCUR</h2>
<h3><em>When you must not take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not take Androcur if you have an allergy to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>cyproterone acetate, the active ingredient in Androcur</li>
<li>any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>shortness of breath</li>
<li>wheezing or difficulty breathing</li>
<li>swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body</li>
<li>rash, itching or hives on the skin</li>
</ul>
<p>Androcur should not be taken by children and adolescents below 18 years of age or girls who have not completed puberty.</p>
<p><strong>Do not take this medicine if you are pregnant or suspect you may be pregnant.</strong> It may affect your developing baby if you take it during pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>Do not breastfeed if you are taking this medicine.</strong> The active ingredient in Androcur passes into breast milk and there is a possibility that your baby may be affected.</p>
<p><strong>Do not take Androcur if you have any of the following medical conditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>liver disease, previous or existing liver tumours unless they are caused by metastases from prostate cancer (your doctor would have told you if you have this)</li>
<li>Dubin-Johnson or Rotor syndrome (your doctor would have told you if you have either of these conditions)</li>
<li>history of jaundice (yellow skin or eyes), herpes or persistent itching during a previous pregnancy</li>
<li>previous or existing benign brain tumour (meningioma)</li>
<li>wasting disease (a disease causing muscle loss or loss of strength, with the exception of prostate cancer)</li>
<li>severe and persistent depression</li>
<li>previous or existing conditions relating to formation of blood clots</li>
<li>severe diabetes with blood vessel changes (your doctor would have told you if you have this)</li>
<li>sickle-cell anaemia (your doctor would have told you if you have this)</li>
</ul>
<p>Androcur tablets contain lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking Androcur.</p>
<p><strong>Do not take this medicine after the expiry date printed on the pack and blister.</strong> The expiry date is printed on the carton and on each blister after “EXP” (e.g. 11 18 refers to November 2018). The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. If it has expired return it to your pharmacist for disposal.</p>
<p><strong>Do not take this medicine if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering.</strong> If the packaging is damaged, return it to your pharmacist for disposal.</p>
<p><strong>If you are not sure whether you should start taking this medicine, talk to your doctor.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Before you start to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you have allergies to any other medicines, foods, preservatives or dyes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you have or have had any medical conditions, especially the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>diabetes</li>
<li>history of blood clotting or sickle cell anaemia</li>
<li>osteoporosis, a family history of osteoporosis or risk factors for developing osteoporosis (such as smoking, a diet low in calcium, poor mobility, a slight build or treatment with steroid medicines)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or are breastfeeding.</strong> If taken during pregnancy, Androcur may lead to signs of feminisation in the male foetus. Therefore, your doctor will check that you are not pregnant before you start taking Androcur. Women should use a reliable form of contraception while taking Androcur.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if fertility after treatment is important.</strong> For men it is recommended that a sperm count is taken to establish fertility before commencing Androcur. It can take 3-20 months for fertile sperm production to be re-established after stopping this medicine.</p>
<p>The long-term effects of Androcur on female fertility are not known.</p>
<p><strong>If you have not told your doctor about any of the above, tell them before you start taking Androcur.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Taking other medicines</em></h3>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, including any that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.</strong></p>
<p>Some medicines and Androcur may interfere with each other. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>phenytoin, a medicine used to treat epilepsy</li>
<li>medicines used to treat fungal infections, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clotrimazole</li>
<li>ritonavir, a medicine used in the treatment of HIV</li>
<li>rifampicin, an antibiotic used to treat infections such as tuberculosis and leprosy</li>
<li>St John's wort, a herbal remedy used to treat mood disorders</li>
<li>Statins (HMGCoA inhibitors), medicines used to lower cholesterol levels in people with or at risk of cardiovascular disease</li>
<li>medicines used to treat diabetes</li>
</ul>
<p>These medicines may be affected by Androcur, or may affect how well it works. You may need different amounts of your medicine, or you may need to take different medicines.</p>
<p>Your doctor and pharmacist may have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while taking this medicine.</p>
<h2>HOW TO TAKE ANDROCUR</h2>
<p><strong>Follow all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist carefully.</strong> They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not understand the instructions printed on the pharmacist label, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How much to take</em></h3>
<p>Your doctor will advise of the most suitable dose for you to take.</p>
<p><strong>Do not alter the dose yourself.</strong> Your doctor will advise you if changing the dose is necessary.</p>
<p><strong>MEN:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prostate cancer</strong></p>
<p>The usual daily dose is 50-300 mg of Androcur. Your doctor may request you take Androcur with other medicines and/or change your dose during treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Reduction of abnormal sex drive</strong></p>
<p>Generally treatment is started with 50 mg of Androcur twice daily and may be increased to 100 mg twice daily or three times daily before reducing gradually to the lowest effective dose. Your doctor may change your dose during treatment.</p>
<p><strong>WOMEN:</strong></p>
<p>If you are of childbearing age, you should commence your tablet taking on the 1st day of your cycle (= 1st day of bleeding). If you have no menstrual periods (amenorrhoea) your treatment can start immediately. In this case, the first day of treatment is to be regarded as the 1st day of the cycle.</p>
<p>Starting from day 1 take 50-100 mg (as advised by your doctor) of Androcur daily from the 1st to the 10th day of the cycle (= for 10 days). Additionally, your doctor will advise the most appropriate contraceptive for you to take to provide the necessary contraceptive protection and to stabilise your cycle.</p>
<p>Your doctor will re-evaluate your treatment when you reach menopause. Long-term use (years) of Androcur should be avoided.</p>
<p>If you are postmenopausal or have had a hysterectomy, Androcur may be administered alone. The usual dose is 25-50 mg of Androcur once daily for 21 days, followed by a 7-day tablet-free interval.</p>
<p>Shortness of breath may occur at high doses.</p>
<h3><em>How to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Swallow the tablets whole with some liquid after meals.</strong></p>
<h3><em>When to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Take your medicine after meals at about the same time each day.</strong> Taking it at the same time each day will have the best effect. It will also help you remember when to take it.</p>
<p>Missed Androcur tablets may diminish the effectiveness of treatment and may lead to breakthrough bleeding in women.</p>
<h3><em>How long to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Continue taking your medicine for as long as your doctor tells you.</strong></p>
<p>This medicine helps to control your condition, but does not cure it. It is important to keep taking your medicine even if you feel well.</p>
<h3><em>If you forget to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Otherwise, take it as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking your medicine as you would normally.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed.</strong> This may increase the chance of you getting an unwanted side effect.</p>
<p><strong>If you are also taking an oral contraceptive and more than 12 hours has elapsed from the time Androcur was due to be taken, note that contraceptive protection in this cycle may be reduced and thus there is an increased risk of becoming pregnant.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints.</strong></p>
<h3><em>If you take too much (overdose)</em></h3>
<p><strong>Immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 for advice, or go to Accident and Emergency at the nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much Androcur. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.</strong> You may need urgent medical attention.</p>
<h2>WHILE YOU ARE TAKING ANDROCUR</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p><strong>If you are about to be started on any new medicine, remind your doctor and pharmacist that you are taking Androcur.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell any other doctors, dentists, and pharmacists who treat you that you are taking this medicine.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keep all of your doctor’s appointments so that your progress can be checked.</strong> Your doctor may do some tests from time to time to make sure the medicine is working and to prevent unwanted side effects.</p>

<p>If you have diabetes, your doctor will monitor you to ensure that you receive the appropriate dose of oral antidiabetic or insulin whilst taking Androcur.</p>
<p>Your doctor will also check your red-blood cell count to ensure you do not become anaemic during treatment with Androcur.</p>
<p><strong>If you are a female taking an oral contraceptive during treatment, tell your doctor if your period does not occur during the tablet-free / placebo interval.</strong> Your doctor may need to check whether you are pregnant before you can continue treatment.</p>
<p><strong>If you are a male taking Androcur to reduce abnormal sex drive, you should consider undertaking additional measures such as therapy or counselling in order to take advantage of the period of reduced drive.</strong> These measures may assist in achieving personal and social re-orientation.</p>

<p><strong>Do not give your medicine to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.</strong></p>

Consumer Medicine Information
WHAT IS IN THIS LEAFLET
This leaflet answers some common questions about Androcur.
It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.
All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking Androcur against the benefits they expect it will have for you.
If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Keep this leaflet with the medicine. You may need to read it again.
WHAT ANDROCUR IS USED FOR
Androcur is an anti-androgen medicine.
Androgens such as testosterone are natural male sex hormones which are also produced, to a slight extent, in females.
MEN: 
In men, androgens may help cancer cells to grow in some types of prostate cancer. By blocking these hormones, Androcur may slow or stop the growth of cancer. Androcur may also be used in combination with other medicines or following surgical removal of the testes to treat side effects such as “hot flushes” or “sweats” and to prevent any initial worsening of the disease.
Androcur is also used to reduce abnormal sex drive in men.
WOMEN: 
In women, androgens may increase hair growth, loss of scalp hair and secretion of oil from the sweat glands. By blocking these hormones, Androcur may slow or stop excessive hairiness, loss of scalp hair, acne, oily skin and dandruff.
Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you. Your doctor may have prescribed it for another reason.
This medicine is available only with a doctor’s prescription.
BEFORE YOU TAKE ANDROCUR
When you must not take it
Do not take Androcur if you have an allergy to:

cyproterone acetate, the active ingredient in Androcur
any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet

Some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction may include:

shortness of breath
wheezing or difficulty breathing
swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body
rash, itching or hives on the skin

Androcur should not be taken by children and adolescents below 18 years of age or girls who have not completed puberty.
Do not take this medicine if you are pregnant or suspect you may be pregnant. It may affect your developing baby if you take it during pregnancy.
Do not breastfeed if you are taking this medicine. The active ingredient in Androcur passes into breast milk and there is a possibility that your baby may be affected.
Do not take Androcur if you have any of the following medical conditions:

liver disease, previous or existing liver tumours unless they are caused by metastases from prostate cancer (your doctor would have told you if you have this)
Dubin-Johnson or Rotor syndrome (your doctor would have told you if you have either of these conditions)
history of jaundice (yellow skin or eyes), herpes or persistent itching during a previous pregnancy
previous or existing benign brain tumour (meningioma)
wasting disease (a disease causing muscle loss or loss of strength, with the exception of prostate cancer)
severe and persistent depression
previous or existing conditions relating to formation of blood clots
severe diabetes with blood vessel changes (your doctor would have told you if you have this)
sickle-cell anaemia (your doctor would have told you if you have this)

Androcur tablets contain lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars, contact your doctor before taking Androcur.
Do not take this medicine after the expiry date printed on the pack and blister. The expiry date is printed on the carton and on each blister after “EXP” (e.g. 11 18 refers to November 2018). The expiry date refers to the last day of that month. If it has expired return it to your pharmacist for disposal.
Do not take this medicine if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering. If the packaging is damaged, return it to your pharmacist for disposal.
If you are not sure whether you should start taking this medicine, talk to your doctor.
Before you start to take it
Tell your doctor if you have allergies to any other medicines, foods, preservatives or dyes.
Tell your doctor if you have or have had any medical conditions, especially the following:

diabetes
history of blood clotting or sickle cell anaemia
osteoporosis, a family history of osteoporosis or risk factors for developing osteoporosis (such as smoking, a diet low in calcium, poor mobility, a slight build or treatment with steroid medicines)

Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or are breastfeeding. If taken during pregnancy, Androcur may lead to signs of feminisation in the male foetus. Therefore, your doctor will check that you are not pregnant before you start taking Androcur. Women should use a reliable form of contraception while taking Androcur.
Tell your doctor if fertility after treatment is important. For men it is recommended that a sperm count is taken to establish fertility before commencing Androcur. It can take 3-20 months for fertile sperm production to be re-established after stopping this medicine.
The long-term effects of Androcur on female fertility are not known.
If you have not told your doctor about any of the above, tell them before you start taking Androcur.
Taking other medicines
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, including any that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.
Some medicines and Androcur may interfere with each other. These include:

phenytoin, a medicine used to treat epilepsy
medicines used to treat fungal infections, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, clotrimazole
ritonavir, a medicine used in the treatment of HIV
rifampicin, an antibiotic used to treat infections such as tuberculosis and leprosy
St John's wort, a herbal remedy used to treat mood disorders
Statins (HMGCoA inhibitors), medicines used to lower cholesterol levels in people with or at risk of cardiovascular disease
medicines used to treat diabetes

These medicines may be affected by Androcur, or may affect how well it works. You may need different amounts of your medicine, or you may need to take different medicines.
Your doctor and pharmacist may have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while taking this medicine.
HOW TO TAKE ANDROCUR
Follow all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist carefully. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.
If you do not understand the instructions printed on the pharmacist label, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.
How much to take
Your doctor will advise of the most suitable dose for you to take.
Do not alter the dose yourself. Your doctor will advise you if changing the dose is necessary.
MEN:
Prostate cancer
The usual daily dose is 50-300 mg of Androcur. Your doctor may request you take Androcur with other medicines and/or change your dose during treatment.
Reduction of abnormal sex drive
Generally treatment is started with 50 mg of Androcur twice daily and may be increased to 100 mg twice daily or three times daily before reducing gradually to the lowest effective dose. Your doctor may change your dose during treatment.
WOMEN:
If you are of childbearing age, you should commence your tablet taking on the 1st day of your cycle (= 1st day of bleeding). If you have no menstrual periods (amenorrhoea) your treatment can start immediately. In this case, the first day of treatment is to be regarded as the 1st day of the cycle.
Starting from day 1 take 50-100 mg (as advised by your doctor) of Androcur daily from the 1st to the 10th day of the cycle (= for 10 days). Additionally, your doctor will advise the most appropriate contraceptive for you to take to provide the necessary contraceptive protection and to stabilise your cycle.
Your doctor will re-evaluate your treatment when you reach menopause. Long-term use (years) of Androcur should be avoided.
If you are postmenopausal or have had a hysterectomy, Androcur may be administered alone. The usual dose is 25-50 mg of Androcur once daily for 21 days, followed by a 7-day tablet-free interval.
Shortness of breath may occur at high doses.
How to take it
Swallow the tablets whole with some liquid after meals.
When to take it
Take your medicine after meals at about the same time each day. Taking it at the same time each day will have the best effect. It will also help you remember when to take it.
Missed Androcur tablets may diminish the effectiveness of treatment and may lead to breakthrough bleeding in women.
How long to take it
Continue taking your medicine for as long as your doctor tells you.
This medicine helps to control your condition, but does not cure it. It is important to keep taking your medicine even if you feel well.
If you forget to take it
If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to.
Otherwise, take it as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking your medicine as you would normally.
Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed. This may increase the chance of you getting an unwanted side effect.
If you are also taking an oral contraceptive and more than 12 hours has elapsed from the time Androcur was due to be taken, note that contraceptive protection in this cycle may be reduced and thus there is an increased risk of becoming pregnant.
If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints.
If you take too much (overdose)
Immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre on 13 11 26 for advice, or go to Accident and Emergency at the nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much Androcur. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. You may need urgent medical attention.
WHILE YOU ARE TAKING ANDROCUR
Things you must do
If you are about to be started on any new medicine, remind your doctor and pharmacist that you are taking Androcur.
Tell any other doctors, dentists, and pharmacists who treat you that you are taking this medicine.
Keep all of your doctor’s appointments so that your progress can be checked. Your doctor may do some tests from time to time to make sure the medicine is working and to prevent unwanted side effects.
Your doctor will check your liver function during treatment with Androcur and whenever any symptoms or signs suggesting liver problems are observed.
If you have diabetes, your doctor will monitor you to ensure that you receive the appropriate dose of oral antidiabetic or insulin whilst taking Androcur.
Your doctor will also check your red-blood cell count to ensure you do not become anaemic during treatment with Androcur.
If you are a female taking an oral contraceptive during treatment, tell your doctor if your period does not occur during the tablet-free / placebo interval. Your doctor may need to check whether you are pregnant before you can continue treatment.
If you are a male taking Androcur to reduce abnormal sex drive, you should consider undertaking additional measures such as therapy or counselling in order to take advantage of the period of reduced drive. These measures may assist in achieving personal and social re-orientation.
Things you must not do
Do not take Androcur to treat any other complaints unless your doctor tells you to.
Do not give your medicine to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.
Do not stop taking your medicine or lower the dosage without checking with your doctor. If you stop taking it suddenly, your condition may worsen or you may have unwanted side effects.
Things to be careful of
Be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how Androcur affects you. This medicine may cause tiredness and can impair the ability to concentrate. If you have any of these symptoms, do not drive, operate machinery or do anything else that could be dangerous.
Be careful when drinking alcohol while you are taking this medicine. If you drink alcohol, tiredness and the ability to concentrate may be worse. Alcohol may prevent Androcur from working as well as it should in reducing abnormal sex drive.

<p><strong>Consumer Medicine Information</strong></p>
<h2>What is in this leaflet</h2>
<p>This leaflet answers some common questions about PENTASA.</p>
<p>It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>Please read this leaflet before you start using PENTASA.</p>

<h2>What PENTASA is used for</h2>
<p>This medicine is used to treat Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, diseases associated with inflammation, ulcers and sores in the bowel causing bleeding, stomach pain, and diarrhoea.</p>
<p>The active ingredient in PENTASA is mesalazine. It is an anti-inflammatory agent, similar to aspirin, and is thought to work by reducing inflammation in the bowel.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you.</strong> Your doctor may have prescribed it for another reason.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that PENTASA is addictive.</p>
<p>It is available only with a doctor's prescription.</p>

<li>a kidney or liver problem a bleeding disorder</li>
<li>a history of asthma.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or are breast-feeding.</strong> Your doctor can discuss with you the risks and benefits involved. PENTASA should be used with caution during pregnancy and breast-feeding and only if the potential benefits outweigh the possible risks in the opinion of the doctor. The underlying condition itself (inflammatory bowel disease) may increase risks for the pregnancy outcome.</p>
<p><strong>If you have not told your doctor about any of the above, tell him/her before you start using PENTASA.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Taking other medicines</em></h3>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using any other medicines, including any that you get without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.</strong></p>

Consumer Medicine Information
What is in this leaflet
This leaflet answers some common questions about PENTASA.
It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.
Please read this leaflet before you start using PENTASA.
All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you using PENTASA against the benefits they expect it will have for you.
If you have any concerns about using this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Keep this leaflet with the medicine. You may need to read it again.
What PENTASA is used for
This medicine is used to treat Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, diseases associated with inflammation, ulcers and sores in the bowel causing bleeding, stomach pain, and diarrhoea.
The active ingredient in PENTASA is mesalazine. It is an anti-inflammatory agent, similar to aspirin, and is thought to work by reducing inflammation in the bowel.
Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you. Your doctor may have prescribed it for another reason.
There is no evidence that PENTASA is addictive.
It is available only with a doctor's prescription.
It is not expected to affect your ability to drive a car or operate machinery.
Before you take PENTASA
When you must not take it
Do not take PENTASA if you have an allergy to:

any medicine containing mesalazine or aspirin-like medicines
any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet.

Some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction may include:

shortness of breath, wheezing or difficulty breathing
swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body
rash, itching or hives on the skin.

Do not take PENTASA if you have a severe kidney or liver problem.
Do not take PENTASA after the expiry date printed on the pack or if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering. If it has expired or is damaged, return it to your pharmacist for disposal.
Do not give PENTASA to a child 12 years old or under. The safety and effectiveness of PENTASA in this age group have not been established.
Before you start to take it
Tell your doctor if you have allergies to any other medicines, foods, preservatives or dyes.
Tell your doctor if you have or have had any of the following medical conditions:

a known allergy to PENTASA, sulfasalazine or aspirin-like medicines, or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet
a kidney or liver problem a bleeding disorder
a history of asthma.

Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or are breast-feeding. Your doctor can discuss with you the risks and benefits involved. PENTASA should be used with caution during pregnancy and breast-feeding and only if the potential benefits outweigh the possible risks in the opinion of the doctor. The underlying condition itself (inflammatory bowel disease) may increase risks for the pregnancy outcome.
If you have not told your doctor about any of the above, tell him/her before you start using PENTASA.
Taking other medicines
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using any other medicines, including any that you get without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.
There is no information available on interactions between PENTASA and other medicines. However, mesalazine belongs to a group of medicines called salicylates that may interfere with the following types of medicines:

anti-coagulants, used to thin blood or stop blood clots (eg warfarin)
glucocorticoids, used to treat inflammation, swelling or allergies (eg prednisolone)
sulphonylureas, used to lower blood sugar and treat diabetes (eg glibenclamide, glipizide)
methotrexate, used to treat some kinds of cancers and arthritis
probenicid or sulfinpyrazone, used to treat gout
spirinolactone or frusemide, used to increase the amount of urine produced, and to lower blood pressure
rifampicin, used to treat tuberculosis
azathioprine, used to suppress the immune system
mercaptopurine and thioguanine, used to treat leukaemia.

Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about taking any of these medicines.
Your doctor and pharmacist have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while taking this medicine.

<p><strong>If you do not understand the instructions on the bottle, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How much to take</em></h3>

<p><strong>Take the capsules exactly as instructed by your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Immediately telephone your doctor, or the Australian Poisons Information Centre (telephone 131 126), or the New Zealand National Poisons Centre (telephone 0800 POISON or 0800 764 766) or go to accident and emergency at your nearest hospital, if you think you or anyone else may have taken too much DANTRIUM.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.</strong> You may need urgent medical attention.</p>
<h2>While you are taking DANTRIUM</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Keep all your doctor's appointments so your progress and health can be monitored.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If you are about to be started on any new medicine, tell your doctor and pharmacist that you are being treated with DANTRIUM.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell all doctors, dentists and pharmacists who are treating you that you are taking DANTRIUM.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>

<h3><em>Things to be careful of</em></h3>
<p><strong>Be careful of exposure to sunlight while being treated with DANTRIUM.</strong></p>
<p>DANTRIUM may increase sensitivity of the skin to sun. Symptoms of sunburn (such as redness, itching, swelling or blistering) may occur more quickly than normal.</p>
<h2>Side effects</h2>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking DANTRIUM.</strong></p>
<p>All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical attention if you get some of the side effects.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to tell whether side effects are the result of taking DANTRIUM, effects of your condition or side effects of other medicines you may be taking. For this reason it is important to tell your doctor of any change in your condition.</p>
<p><strong>Do not be alarmed by the list of side effects.</strong> You may not experience any of them.</p>

How to take DANTRIUM
Follow all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist carefully. These may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.
If you do not understand the instructions on the bottle, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.
How much to take
Your doctor will decide how much DANTRIUM you should take each day and how long your treatment with DANTRIUM should continue.
Take the capsules exactly as instructed by your doctor or pharmacist.
When to take it
Your doctor will tell you how many times a day you should take DANTRIUM.
Always read the pharmacist's label to check the exact dose and how often to take it.

While you are taking DANTRIUM
Things you must do
Keep all your doctor's appointments so your progress and health can be monitored.
DANTRIUM can cause damage to your liver, so your liver function needs to be checked regularly by your doctor to detect any abnormalities.
If you become pregnant while being treated with DANTRIUM, tell your doctor immediately.

Things you must not do
Do not take DANTRIUM to treat any other complaints unless your doctor tells you to.
Do not give your medicine to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.
Do not drive or operate machinery while you are taking DANTRIUM.
DANTRIUM causes drowsiness, dizziness and weakness in some people and therefore may affect alertness.
Avoid drinking alcohol or taking medicines to reduce anxiety or help you sleep. These may increase the drowsiness and dizziness effects of DANTRIUM and should be avoided.
Things to be careful of
Be careful of exposure to sunlight while being treated with DANTRIUM.
DANTRIUM may increase sensitivity of the skin to sun. Symptoms of sunburn (such as redness, itching, swelling or blistering) may occur more quickly than normal.

All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical attention if you get some of the side effects.
It can be difficult to tell whether side effects are the result of taking DANTRIUM, effects of your condition or side effects of other medicines you may be taking. For this reason it is important to tell your doctor of any change in your condition.
Do not be alarmed by the list of side effects. You may not experience any of them.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.

<h3>Description:</h3><h1>Femoston®-Conti</h1>
<p><em>estradiol and dydrogesterone</em></p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Consumer Medicine Information</strong></p>
<h2>What is in this leaflet</h2>
<p>This leaflet answers some common questions about Femoston-Conti.</p>
<p>It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking this medicine against the benefits they expect it will have for you.</p>
<p><strong>If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keep this leaflet with the medicine.</strong> You may need to read it again.</p>
<h2>When you must not use Femoston-Conti</h2>
<p><strong>Do not use Femoston-Conti or other estrogens, with or without a progestogen to prevent heart attacks, stroke or dementia.</strong></p>
<p>A study called the Women's Health Initiative indicated increased risk of heart attack, stroke, breast cancer, and blood clots in the legs or lungs in women receiving treatment with a product containing conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg and the progestogen medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). The researchers stopped the study after 5 years when it was determined the risks were greater than the benefits in this group.</p>
<p>The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study indicated increased risk of dementia in women aged 65-79 years taking conjugated estrogens and MPA. There are no comparable data currently available for others doses of conjugated estrogens and MPA or others combinations of estrogens and progestogens. Therefore, you should assume the risks will be similar for other medicines containing estrogen and progestogen combinations.</p>
<p><strong>Talk regularly with your doctor about whether you still need treatment with Femoston-Conti.</strong></p>
<p>Treatment with estrogens, with or without progestogens should be used at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest period of time.</p>
<h2>What Femoston-Conti is used for</h2>
<p>Femoston-Conti is a type of treatment called hormone replacement therapy (HRT). It contains the hormones estradiol and dydrogesterone.</p>
<p>This medicine helps to relieve the discomfort many women feel during and after the menopause. It also helps to prevent thinning of the bones (osteoporosis), which can cause fractures. Femoston-Conti is used by women who still have a uterus (womb).</p>
<p>Menopause may be natural or occur after surgery or medical treatment.</p>
<p>HRT should not be used for the long-term maintenance of general health or to prevent heart disease. Femoston is not a contraceptive (birth control) and will not prevent pregnancy or restore fertility. Since pregnancy may be possible early in the menopause while you are still having menstrual periods, you should ask your doctor to suggest another (non-hormonal) method of birth control.</p>
<h3><em>How it works</em></h3>
<p>Estradiol is a natural female sex hormone called an estrogen. It is the same hormone that your ovaries were producing before the menopause. Dydrogesterone is a hormone called a progestogen. It has effects like the female hormone, progesterone, which your ovaries also produced before the menopause.</p>
<p>Menopause generally occurs between the ages of 45 and 55, because your body's production of estrogen decreases. This can cause unpleasant symptoms such as a feeling of warmth in the face, neck and chest, ""hot flushes"" (sudden intense feelings of heat and sweating throughout the body), sleep problems, irritability and depression. Some women also have problems with urine control or with dryness of the vagina causing discomfort during or after sex. Estrogens can be given to reduce these symptoms.</p>
<p>After the age of 40, and especially after the menopause, some women develop osteoporosis. This is a thinning of the bones that makes them weaker and more likely to break, especially the bones of the spine, hip and wrist. The risk of osteoporosis is increased by lack of estrogen. Estrogens can be given to reduce this risk if other treatments are not suitable.</p>
<p>Women who still have a uterus must take both estrogen and progestogen as part of HRT. This is because estrogen stimulates the growth of the lining of the uterus (called the endometrium). Before menopause this lining is removed during your period through the action of your natural progestogen. After menopause, taking estrogen on its own as HRT may lead to irregular bleeding and to a disorder called endometrial hyperplasia. Progestogens such as dydrogesterone help to protect the lining of the uterus from developing this disorder.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why it has been prescribed for you.</strong> Your doctor may have prescribed it for another purpose.</p>
<p>This medicine is not addictive.</p>
<p>This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription.</p>
<h2>Before you take Femoston-Conti</h2>
<h3><em>When you must not take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>HRT should only be used if you have been fully informed of the risks.</strong></p>
<p>The decision to use HRT should be based on your symptoms and health, and made after a careful medical evaluation.</p>
<p><strong>Do not take Femoston-Conti if you have an allergy to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>any medicine containing estradiol or dydrogesterone</strong></li>
<li><strong>any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some symptoms of an allergic reaction include skin rash, itching, shortness of breath or swelling of the face, lips or tongue, which may cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing.</p>
<p><strong>Do not take Femoston-Conti if you have/have experienced:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A hysterectomy</li>
<li>Cancer of the breast or uterus (endometrium) or any other estrogen or progestogen dependent cancer.</li>
<li>Blood clots. Painful inflammation or blockages of a blood vessel in the legs, lungs, brain or heart</li>
<li>Any condition that increases the tendency for you to get blood clots</li>
<li>Untreated endometrial hyperplasia (the lining of the uterus becomes too thick)</li>
<li>Abnormal vaginal bleeding that has not been investigated</li>
<li>Severe liver disease</li>
<li>A condition called porphyria</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not sure whether any of the above conditions apply to you, your doctor can advise you.</p>
<p><strong>Do not take this medicine if you are pregnant. Discuss with your doctor if you are planning on becoming pregnant.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not breastfeed if you are taking this medicine.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not give Femoston-Conti to a child under the age of 18 years.</strong> Safety and effectiveness in children younger than 18 years have not been established.</p>
<p><strong>You must stop taking Femoston-Conti 4 weeks before certain types of surgery.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not take it after the expiry date printed on the pack or if the packaging is damaged or shows signs of tampering.</strong> If it has expired or is damaged return it to your pharmacist for disposal.</p>
<h3><em>Before you start to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have any allergies to any other medicines, foods, preservatives or dyes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You must have a thorough medical check-up before starting HRT for the first time or recommencing HRT.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you have or have had any of the following medical conditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a family history of breast cancer</li>
<li>nodules, lumps or cysts in your breasts or any other benign breast condition (not cancer)</li>
<li>fibroids or other benign tumours of the uterus (not cancer)</li>
<li>ovarian cancer</li>
<li>unusual or irregular bleeding or spotting from the vagina</li>
<li>endometriosis</li>
<li>high blood pressure</li>
<li>liver problems</li>
<li>cholestatic jaundice (obstruction of bile)</li>
<li>kidney problems</li>
<li>heart problems</li>
<li>diabetes</li>
<li>migraine or severe headache</li>
<li>asthma</li>
<li>epilepsy</li>
<li>systemic lupus erythematosus</li>
<li>gall stones or gall bladder disease</li>
<li>a high level of triglycerides (fats) in the blood</li>
<li>high or low levels of calcium in the blood.</li>
<li>Abnormal vision</li>
<li>Hypothyroidism</li>
<li>Otosclerosis - hearing loss due to a problem with the bones in the ear</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you are likely to have an increased risk of developing blood clots in your blood vessels.</strong></p>
<p>The risk increases as you get older and it may also be increased if:</p>
<ul>
<li>anyone in your immediate family has ever had blood clots in the blood vessels of the legs or lungs</li>
<li>you are overweight</li>
<li>you have varicose veins</li>
<li>you have a disorder called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).</li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor will advise you whether or not to take Femoston-Conti, or if you need to adjust the dose, or adapt your treatment.</p>
<h3><em>Taking other medicines</em></h3>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines, including any that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food store.</strong></p>
<p>Some medicines and Femoston-Conti may interfere with each other. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>herbal medicines containing St John's wort</li>
<li>some medicines for epilepsy such as phenytoin, phenobarbitone and carbamazepine</li>
<li>some antibiotics and anti-infectives such as rifampicin and ritonavir</li>
<li>some medicines with a narrow therapeutic index such as Tacrolimus, ciclosporin, Fentanyl and Theophylline</li>
</ul>
<p>These medicines may be affected by Femoston-Conti, or may affect how well it works. You may need to use different amounts of your medicine, or take different medicines.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist has more information on medicines to be careful with or to avoid while taking Femoston-Conti.</p>
<h2>How to take Femoston-Conti</h2>
<p><strong>Follow all directions given to you by your doctor carefully.</strong> They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not understand the instructions on the box, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.</strong></p>
<h3><em>When to start taking it</em></h3>
<p>If you are having regular periods, you may start taking Femoston-Conti on the first day of your period. If you are having irregular periods, discuss the starting day with your doctor. If you have not had a period for 12 months or more, you can start Femoston-Conti immediately.</p>
<h3><em>How much to take</em></h3>
<p>The usual dose is one tablet daily.</p>
<h3><em>How to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Swallow the tablets whole with a glass of water.</strong></p>
<h3><em>When to take it</em></h3>
<p>It does not matter if you take this medicine before or after food.</p>
<p><strong>Take Femoston-Conti at about the same time each day.</strong> Taking it at the same time each day will have the best effect. It will also help you remember when to take it.</p>
<p>The tablets are labelled with the days of the week to help you make sure you are taking your tablets every day.</p>
<p><strong>You should start with a tablet labelled according to the day of the week.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You should start each new pack the day after you have finished the old pack. Do not leave a gap between packs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If changing from sequential HRT, you should commence at the end of the estrogen plus progestogen phase of the sequential therapy without a break.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How long to take it</em></h3>
<p>Your doctor can advise you how long you may need to take Femoston-Conti.</p>
<p>Your doctor can discuss the risks and benefits of long-term treatment with HRT. Some recent studies have shown that women using HRT have a small increase in breast cancer risk after several years of use. The risk increases with the length of HRT use.</p>
<p>Recent studies have also shown that HRT is associated with a small increase in the risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots, including clots in the lungs. The studies also show that the risk of hip fractures and bowel cancer may be reduced.</p>
<p>Another study has shown that in women older than 65 years, HRT is associated with a small increase in the risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. It is not known if this finding applies to younger women.</p>
<p><strong>Continue taking Femoston-Conti for as long as your doctor recommends.</strong></p>
<h3><em>If you forget to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to.</strong></p>
<p>A slight vaginal bleeding, like an irregular period, may occur.</p>
<p><strong>Otherwise, take it as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking your medicine as you would normally.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have forgotten to take more than one tablet, discuss this with your doctor.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have trouble remembering when to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for advice.</strong></p>
<h3><em>If you take too much (overdose)</em></h3>
<p><strong>Immediately telephone your doctor, or the Poisons Information Centre 13 11 26, or go to Accident and Emergency at your nearest hospital, if you think you or anyone else may have taken too much Femoston-Conti. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.</strong></p>
<h2>While you are taking Femoston-Conti</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p><strong>If you are about to be started on any new medicine, remind your doctor and pharmacist that you are taking Femoston-Conti.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell any other doctors, dentists and pharmacists who treat you that you are taking this medicine.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor that you are using Femoston-Conti well in advance of any expected hospitalisation or surgery. If you go to hospital unexpectedly, tell the doctor who admits you that you are using it.</strong></p>
<p>The risk of developing blood clots in your blood vessels may be temporarily increased after surgery, serious injury, or having to stay in bed for a long period of time. If possible, this medicine should be stopped at least 4 weeks before surgery and it should not be restarted until you are fully mobile.</p>
<p><strong>If you become pregnant while you are taking this medicine, tell your doctor or pharmacist immediately.</strong></p>
<p><strong>See your doctor at least once a year for a check-up. Some women will need to go more often. Your doctor will check:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>your breasts and order a mammogram at regular intervals</strong></li>
<li><strong>your uterus and cervix and do a pap smear at regular intervals</strong></li>
<li><strong>your blood pressure and cholesterol level</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Check your breasts each month and report any changes promptly to your doctor.</strong> Your doctor or nurse can show you how to check your breasts properly.</p>

Consumer Medicine Information
What is in this leaflet
This leaflet answers some common questions about Femoston-Conti.
It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.
All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking this medicine against the benefits they expect it will have for you.
If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Keep this leaflet with the medicine. You may need to read it again.
When you must not use Femoston-Conti
Do not use Femoston-Conti or other estrogens, with or without a progestogen to prevent heart attacks, stroke or dementia.
A study called the Women's Health Initiative indicated increased risk of heart attack, stroke, breast cancer, and blood clots in the legs or lungs in women receiving treatment with a product containing conjugated estrogens 0.625 mg and the progestogen medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). The researchers stopped the study after 5 years when it was determined the risks were greater than the benefits in this group.
The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study indicated increased risk of dementia in women aged 65-79 years taking conjugated estrogens and MPA. There are no comparable data currently available for others doses of conjugated estrogens and MPA or others combinations of estrogens and progestogens. Therefore, you should assume the risks will be similar for other medicines containing estrogen and progestogen combinations.
Talk regularly with your doctor about whether you still need treatment with Femoston-Conti.
Treatment with estrogens, with or without progestogens should be used at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest period of time.
What Femoston-Conti is used for
Femoston-Conti is a type of treatment called hormone replacement therapy (HRT). It contains the hormones estradiol and dydrogesterone.
This medicine helps to relieve the discomfort many women feel during and after the menopause. It also helps to prevent thinning of the bones (osteoporosis), which can cause fractures. Femoston-Conti is used by women who still have a uterus (womb).
Menopause may be natural or occur after surgery or medical treatment.
HRT should not be used for the long-term maintenance of general health or to prevent heart disease. Femoston is not a contraceptive (birth control) and will not prevent pregnancy or restore fertility. Since pregnancy may be possible early in the menopause while you are still having menstrual periods, you should ask your doctor to suggest another (non-hormonal) method of birth control.
How it works
Estradiol is a natural female sex hormone called an estrogen. It is the same hormone that your ovaries were producing before the menopause. Dydrogesterone is a hormone called a progestogen. It has effects like the female hormone, progesterone, which your ovaries also produced before the menopause.
Menopause generally occurs between the ages of 45 and 55, because your body's production of estrogen decreases. This can cause unpleasant symptoms such as a feeling of warmth in the face, neck and chest, ""hot flushes"" (sudden intense feelings of heat and sweating throughout the body), sleep problems, irritability and depression. Some women also have problems with urine control or with dryness of the vagina causing discomfort during or after sex. Estrogens can be given to reduce these symptoms.
After the age of 40, and especially after the menopause, some women develop osteoporosis. This is a thinning of the bones that makes them weaker and more likely to break, especially the bones of the spine, hip and wrist. The risk of osteoporosis is increased by lack of estrogen. Estrogens can be given to reduce this risk if other treatments are not suitable.
Women who still have a uterus must take both estrogen and progestogen as part of HRT. This is because estrogen stimulates the growth of the lining of the uterus (called the endometrium). Before menopause this lining is removed during your period through the action of your natural progestogen. After menopause, taking estrogen on its own as HRT may lead to irregular bleeding and to a disorder called endometrial hyperplasia. Progestogens such as dydrogesterone help to protect the lining of the uterus from developing this disorder.
Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why it has been prescribed for you. Your doctor may have prescribed it for another purpose.
This medicine is not addictive.
This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription.
Before you take Femoston-Conti
When you must not take it
HRT should only be used if you have been fully informed of the risks.
The decision to use HRT should be based on your symptoms and health, and made after a careful medical evaluation.
Do not take Femoston-Conti if you have an allergy to:

any medicine containing estradiol or dydrogesterone
any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet

Some symptoms of an allergic reaction include skin rash, itching, shortness of breath or swelling of the face, lips or tongue, which may cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing.
Do not take Femoston-Conti if you have/have experienced:

A hysterectomy
Cancer of the breast or uterus (endometrium) or any other estrogen or progestogen dependent cancer.
Blood clots. Painful inflammation or blockages of a blood vessel in the legs, lungs, brain or heart
Any condition that increases the tendency for you to get blood clots
Untreated endometrial hyperplasia (the lining of the uterus becomes too thick)
Abnormal vaginal bleeding that has not been investigated
Severe liver disease
A condition called porphyria

If you are not sure whether any of the above conditions apply to you, your doctor can advise you.
Do not take this medicine if you are pregnant. Discuss with your doctor if you are planning on becoming pregnant.
Do not breastfeed if you are taking this medicine.
Do not give Femoston-Conti to a child under the age of 18 years. Safety and effectiveness in children younger than 18 years have not been established.
You must stop taking Femoston-Conti 4 weeks before certain types of surgery.
Do not take it after the expiry date printed on the pack or if the packaging is damaged or shows signs of tampering. If it has expired or is damaged return it to your pharmacist for disposal.
Before you start to take it
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have any allergies to any other medicines, foods, preservatives or dyes.
You must have a thorough medical check-up before starting HRT for the first time or recommencing HRT.
Tell your doctor if you have or have had any of the following medical conditions:

a family history of breast cancer
nodules, lumps or cysts in your breasts or any other benign breast condition (not cancer)
fibroids or other benign tumours of the uterus (not cancer)
ovarian cancer
unusual or irregular bleeding or spotting from the vagina
endometriosis
high blood pressure
liver problems
cholestatic jaundice (obstruction of bile)
kidney problems
heart problems
diabetes
migraine or severe headache
asthma
epilepsy
systemic lupus erythematosus
gall stones or gall bladder disease
a high level of triglycerides (fats) in the blood
high or low levels of calcium in the blood.
Abnormal vision
Hypothyroidism
Otosclerosis - hearing loss due to a problem with the bones in the ear

Tell your doctor if you are likely to have an increased risk of developing blood clots in your blood vessels.
The risk increases as you get older and it may also be increased if:

anyone in your immediate family has ever had blood clots in the blood vessels of the legs or lungs
you are overweight
you have varicose veins
you have a disorder called systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Your doctor will advise you whether or not to take Femoston-Conti, or if you need to adjust the dose, or adapt your treatment.
Taking other medicines
Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines, including any that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food store.
Some medicines and Femoston-Conti may interfere with each other. These include:

herbal medicines containing St John's wort
some medicines for epilepsy such as phenytoin, phenobarbitone and carbamazepine
some antibiotics and anti-infectives such as rifampicin and ritonavir
some medicines with a narrow therapeutic index such as Tacrolimus, ciclosporin, Fentanyl and Theophylline

These medicines may be affected by Femoston-Conti, or may affect how well it works. You may need to use different amounts of your medicine, or take different medicines.
Your doctor or pharmacist has more information on medicines to be careful with or to avoid while taking Femoston-Conti.
How to take Femoston-Conti
Follow all directions given to you by your doctor carefully. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.
If you do not understand the instructions on the box, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.
When to start taking it
If you are having regular periods, you may start taking Femoston-Conti on the first day of your period. If you are having irregular periods, discuss the starting day with your doctor. If you have not had a period for 12 months or more, you can start Femoston-Conti immediately.
How much to take
The usual dose is one tablet daily.
How to take it
Swallow the tablets whole with a glass of water.
When to take it
It does not matter if you take this medicine before or after food.
Take Femoston-Conti at about the same time each day. Taking it at the same time each day will have the best effect. It will also help you remember when to take it.
The tablets are labelled with the days of the week to help you make sure you are taking your tablets every day.
You should start with a tablet labelled according to the day of the week.
You should start each new pack the day after you have finished the old pack. Do not leave a gap between packs.
If changing from sequential HRT, you should commence at the end of the estrogen plus progestogen phase of the sequential therapy without a break.
How long to take it
Your doctor can advise you how long you may need to take Femoston-Conti.
Your doctor can discuss the risks and benefits of long-term treatment with HRT. Some recent studies have shown that women using HRT have a small increase in breast cancer risk after several years of use. The risk increases with the length of HRT use.
Recent studies have also shown that HRT is associated with a small increase in the risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots, including clots in the lungs. The studies also show that the risk of hip fractures and bowel cancer may be reduced.
Another study has shown that in women older than 65 years, HRT is associated with a small increase in the risk of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. It is not known if this finding applies to younger women.
Continue taking Femoston-Conti for as long as your doctor recommends.
If you forget to take it
If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to.
A slight vaginal bleeding, like an irregular period, may occur.
Otherwise, take it as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking your medicine as you would normally.
Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed.
If you have forgotten to take more than one tablet, discuss this with your doctor.
If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
If you have trouble remembering when to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for advice.
If you take too much (overdose)
Immediately telephone your doctor, or the Poisons Information Centre 13 11 26, or go to Accident and Emergency at your nearest hospital, if you think you or anyone else may have taken too much Femoston-Conti. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.
While you are taking Femoston-Conti
Things you must do
If you are about to be started on any new medicine, remind your doctor and pharmacist that you are taking Femoston-Conti.
Tell any other doctors, dentists and pharmacists who treat you that you are taking this medicine.
Tell your doctor that you are using Femoston-Conti well in advance of any expected hospitalisation or surgery. If you go to hospital unexpectedly, tell the doctor who admits you that you are using it.
The risk of developing blood clots in your blood vessels may be temporarily increased after surgery, serious injury, or having to stay in bed for a long period of time. If possible, this medicine should be stopped at least 4 weeks before surgery and it should not be restarted until you are fully mobile.
If you become pregnant while you are taking this medicine, tell your doctor or pharmacist immediately.
See your doctor at least once a year for a check-up. Some women will need to go more often. Your doctor will check:

your breasts and order a mammogram at regular intervals
your uterus and cervix and do a pap smear at regular intervals
your blood pressure and cholesterol level

Check your breasts each month and report any changes promptly to your doctor. Your doctor or nurse can show you how to check your breasts properly.
If you notice any changes to your breasts, see your doctor.
Include foods that are good sources of calcium and Vitamin D in your daily diet and exercise regularly. Calcium, Vitamin D and exercise may help prevent thinning of the bones. Your doctor can advise you on which foods and types of exercise are best for you.
Things you must not do
Do not use this medicine to treat any other complaints unless your doctor or pharmacist tells you to.
Do not give this medicine to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.
Do not stop taking Femoston-Conti, or change the dosage, without checking with your doctor.

<p><strong>Consumer Medicine Information</strong></p>
<h2>What is in this leaflet</h2>
<p>This leaflet answers some common questions about Neupro.</p>
<p>It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you using Neupro against the benefits they expect it will have for you.</p>

<p><strong>Keep this leaflet with the medicine.</strong> You may need to read it again.</p>
<h2>What Neupro is used for</h2>
<p>Neupro is used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS).</p>
<h3><em>Parkinson’s disease</em></h3>
<p>This is a disease of the nervous system that mainly affects body movement. The main symptoms are shaking (tremor), muscle stiffness and slow unsteady movement. If untreated, Parkinson’s disease can cause difficulty in performing daily activities.</p>
<p>Parkinson’s disease is caused by the brain not making enough of a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine helps the brain to control muscle movement. When too little dopamine is produced slowness of movement results.</p>
<h3><em>Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)</em></h3>
<p>RLS is a condition characterised by unpleasant sensations in the legs and the irresistible urge to move in an effort to relieve these feelings. There is a sense of uneasiness, restlessness, and itching often accompanied by twitching and pain in the legs when sitting or lying down, especially in bed at night. Occasionally the arms may also be affected. RLS is thought to be due to insufficient dopamine levels in the brain.</p>
<p>Neupro belongs to a group of medicines called non-ergot dopamine agonists which stimulate dopamine receptors in the brain to increase the effects of dopamine.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you.</strong></p>
<p>This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription.</p>
<h2>Before you use Neupro</h2>

<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding or wish to breastfeed.</strong> Neupro is not recommended if you are breastfeeding, as it is likely to reduce the amount of milk you produce. Neupro may also pass into your breast milk and affect your baby. If your doctor says you need to use Neupro, you should stop breastfeeding.</p>
<p><strong>If you have not told your doctor or pharmacist about any of the above, tell them before you start using Neupro.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Taking other medicines</em></h3>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines, including medicines you buy without a prescription from a pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.</strong> Some medicines may interfere with Neupro. These include:</p>

<li>shoulder</li>
<li>upper arm</li>
<li>belly</li>
<li>thigh</li>
<li>hip</li>
<li>flank (your side, between your ribs and your hip).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src=""https://www.emims.com.au/resources/drugs/australia/cmi/C0865101.gif""/></p>
<p>To help avoid skin irritation, stick the patch onto a different area of skin each day (for example, on the right side of your body one day, then on the left side the next day and on your upper body one day, then on your lower body). You should not stick Neupro on the same area of skin twice within 14 days.</p>
<p><strong>Things to remember</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You should put the patch where it will <strong>not</strong> be <strong>rubbed by tight clothing</strong> which could make it fall off.</li>

Consumer Medicine Information
What is in this leaflet
This leaflet answers some common questions about Neupro.
It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.
All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you using Neupro against the benefits they expect it will have for you.
If you have any concerns about using this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Keep this leaflet with the medicine. You may need to read it again.
What Neupro is used for
Neupro is used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease and Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS).
Parkinson’s disease
This is a disease of the nervous system that mainly affects body movement. The main symptoms are shaking (tremor), muscle stiffness and slow unsteady movement. If untreated, Parkinson’s disease can cause difficulty in performing daily activities.
Parkinson’s disease is caused by the brain not making enough of a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine helps the brain to control muscle movement. When too little dopamine is produced slowness of movement results.
Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)
RLS is a condition characterised by unpleasant sensations in the legs and the irresistible urge to move in an effort to relieve these feelings. There is a sense of uneasiness, restlessness, and itching often accompanied by twitching and pain in the legs when sitting or lying down, especially in bed at night. Occasionally the arms may also be affected. RLS is thought to be due to insufficient dopamine levels in the brain.
Neupro belongs to a group of medicines called non-ergot dopamine agonists which stimulate dopamine receptors in the brain to increase the effects of dopamine.
Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you.
This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription.
Before you use Neupro
When you must not take it
Do not use Neupro if you have an allergy to:

rotigotine
sodium metabisulfite
any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet.

Some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction may include:

shortness of breath
wheezing or difficulty breathing
swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body
rash, itching or hives on the skin.

Do not use Neupro if you need to have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (method to visualise internal organs and tissues of the body) or cardioversion (treatment of an abnormal heart rhythm). You must take your Neupro patch off before the procedure. You can put a new patch on after the procedure.
Do not give this medicine to a child or adolescent. The safety and effectiveness in children and adolescents has not been established.
Do not use this medicine if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering.
Do not use this medicine after the expiry date (Exp) printed on the pack. If you take this medicine after the expiry date has passed, it may not work.
If you are not sure whether you should start taking Neupro, contact your doctor.
Before you start to use it
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to any other medicines, foods, dyes or preservatives.
Tell your doctor if you have or have had any other health problems or medical conditions, including:

liver problems
low blood pressure
heart problems
mental illness
compulsive disorders such as gambling or a high sex drive
problems with your sight.

Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. The effects of Neupro on pregnancy and the unborn child is not known. Neupro should not be used during pregnancy.
Tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding or wish to breastfeed. Neupro is not recommended if you are breastfeeding, as it is likely to reduce the amount of milk you produce. Neupro may also pass into your breast milk and affect your baby. If your doctor says you need to use Neupro, you should stop breastfeeding.
If you have not told your doctor or pharmacist about any of the above, tell them before you start using Neupro.
Taking other medicines
Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines, including medicines you buy without a prescription from a pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop. Some medicines may interfere with Neupro. These include:

some other medicines used to treat Parkinson’s disease or Restless Legs Syndrome
medicines used to treat depression or mental illness
medicines used to calm you or help you sleep
metoclopramide, a medicine used to treat nausea and vomiting.

These medicines may be affected by Neupro or may affect how well it works. You may need different amounts of your medicine or you may need to take different medicines.
Your doctor or pharmacist has more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while taking Neupro.
How to use Neupro
Follow all directions given to you by your doctor carefully. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.
The dose varies from patient to patient. Your doctor may start you on a low dose of Neupro first and slowly increase the amount of medicine until you are taking enough to control your condition.
Parkinson's Disease
The usual starting dose is one 2 mg/24 hour patch or one 4 mg/24 hour patch daily. This dose will be increased gradually in steps of 2 mg/24 hours until the right (maintenance) dose for your needs is reached.
Restless Legs Syndrome
The usual starting dose is one 1 mg/24 hour patch. If necessary, this dose will be increased gradually in steps of 1 mg/24 hours until the right (maintenance) dose for your needs is reached. The maximum dose is 3 mg/24 hour.
If you do not understand the instructions, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.
Where to apply the patch
Put the sticky side of the patch onto clean, dry, healthy skin on one of the following areas at a time:

shoulder
upper arm
belly
thigh
hip
flank (your side, between your ribs and your hip).


To help avoid skin irritation, stick the patch onto a different area of skin each day (for example, on the right side of your body one day, then on the left side the next day and on your upper body one day, then on your lower body). You should not stick Neupro on the same area of skin twice within 14 days.
Things to remember

You should put the patch where it will not be rubbed by tight clothing which could make it fall off.
If you need to stick the patch to a hairy area of skin, you must shave the area at least three days before sticking the patch there.
Do not stick the patch on broken skin or on skin that is red, irritated or damaged.
Do not use creams, oils, lotions, powders or other skin products on the area of skin you will be sticking the patch on or near a patch you are already wearing. The patch may become loose.
Bathing, showering and exercising should not affect how Neupro works. There is no need to remove the patch when bathing, showering, swimming or exercising. Nevertheless, check that the patch has not fallen off after such activities.
You should avoid external heat (for example excessive sunlight, saunas, hot baths, heating pads or hot-water bottles) on the area of the patch.
If the patch has irritated your skin, you should keep that area of skin covered from the sun, as it may cause changes in the colour of the skin.

How to apply the patch
Each patch is packed in a sachet containing the medicine. You should stick Neupro onto your skin as soon as you have opened the sachet and removed the protective liner.
You should stick a Neupro patch onto the skin once a day. You should leave the patch on your skin for 24 hours and then replace it with a new one. Make sure that you take the old patch off before sticking on the new one. You should replace the patch at around the same time every day.

To open the sachet, hold the two sides of the sachet. Peel apart the foil and open the sachet.



Take the patch out of the sachet.



The sticky side of the patch is covered by a transparent protective liner. Hold the patch in both hands with the protective liner facing you.



Bend the patch in half so that the S-shaped break in the liner opens.

Fold back the other half of the patch and remove the other side of the protective liner.



Press the patch down firmly with the palm of your hand for about 20 - 30 seconds to make sure the patch is touching the skin and that the edges stick well.
It is important to ensure you press the patch firmly for 20 - 30 seconds.


Wash your hands with soap and water immediately after handling the patch.
How to change the patch
Before you put on a new patch, slowly and carefully peel off the used patch.
Gently washing the area with warm water and mild soap should remove any adhesive that stays on your skin after you remove the patch.
You can also use a small amount of baby oil to remove any adhesive that won’t wash off.
Do not use alcohol or other dissolving liquids such as nail polish remover or other solvents as these may irritate your skin.
If the patch falls off, a new patch should be applied for the rest of the day, then replace the patch at the same time as usual.
How long to use Neupro

If you have forgotten to stick on a new patch after removing the old one, use a new patch as soon as you remember. On the following day you should use a new patch at the usual time.
Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.

<p><strong>Follow all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist carefully.</strong> They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not understand the instructions on the box/bottle, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How much to take</em></h3>
<p>Your doctor may adjust this dose depending on the type and severity of the infection.</p>
<p>The usual dose is 250 mg to 500 mg every four to six hours for adults and older children.</p>
<h3><em>How to take ASPECILLIN</em></h3>
<p><strong>For tablets<br/>
Swallow the tablets whole with a full glass of water.</strong></p>
<h3><em>When to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Take your medicine at about the same time each day.</strong> Taking it at the same time each day will have the best effect. It will also help you remember when to take it.</p>
<p>Your medicine is best taken on an empty stomach (one hour before meals and at bedtime), unless otherwise directed by your doctor.</p>
<h3><em>How long to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Continue taking your medicine for as long as your doctor tells you.</strong></p>
<h3><em>If you forget to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>If it almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take you next dose when you are meant to.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Otherwise, take it as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking you medicine as you would normally.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints.</strong></p>
<h3><em>If you take too much (overdose)</em></h3>

<h3><em>What if I am feeling better?</em></h3>
<p>The whole course of antibiotics should be taken, even if you are feeling better. If you stop taking antibiotics too soon the infection may start up again because not all the infection has been killed.</p>

<h2>While you are using it</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>

<p><strong>If you develop itching with swelling of skin rash or difficulty breathing while you are taking ASPECILLIN do not take any more and contact your doctor immediately.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you get severe diarrhoea tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately. Do this even if it occurs several weeks after ASPECILLIN has been stopped.</strong> Diarrhoea may mean that you have a serious condition affecting your bowel. You may need urgent medical care. Do not take any diarrhoea medicine without first checking with your doctor.</p>
<p><strong>If you get a sore white mouth or tongue while taking or soon after stopping ASPECILLIN, tell your doctor. Also tell your doctor if you get vaginal itching or discharge.</strong> This may mean you have a fungal infection called thrush.

<p><strong>Tell any other doctors, dentists, and pharmacists who treat you that you are taking this medicine.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not stop taking ASPECILLIN because you are feeling better, unless advised by your doctor.</strong> If you do not complete the full course prescribed by your doctor, all of the bacteria causing your infection may not be killed. These bacteria may continue to grow and multiply so that your infection may not clear completely or it may return.</p>
<p><strong>Do not take ASPECILLIN to treat any other complaints unless your doctor tells you to.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not give your medicine to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.</strong></p>

<h2>What Apidra is used for</h2>
<p>Apidra is used to reduce high blood sugar (glucose) levels in people with diabetes mellitus.</p>
<p>Apidra is a modified insulin that is very similar to human insulin. It is a substitute for the insulin produced by the pancreas.</p>
<p>Apidra is a short-acting insulin. Your doctor may tell you to use a long-acting insulin in combination with Apidra.</p>
<p>Apidra is not addictive.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why Apidra has been prescribed for you.</strong></p>
<h2>Before you use Apidra</h2>
<h3><em>When you must not use Apidra</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not use Apidra:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- If you have an allergy to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>any medicine containing insulin</li>
<li>any of the ingredients contained in Apidra listed at the end of this leaflet</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>redness, swelling, rash and itching at the injection site</li>
<li>rash, itching or hives on the skin</li>
<li>shortness of breath</li>
<li>wheezing or difficulty breathing</li>
<li>swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>- If you are experiencing low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia - a ""hypo"").</strong> <br>
If you have a lot of hypos discuss appropriate treatment with your doctor.</br></p>
<p><strong>- After the expiry date printed on the pack or if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering.</strong> <br/>
If you use Apidra after the expiry date has passed, it may not work as well. If it has expired or is damaged, return it to your pharmacist for disposal.</p>
<p><strong>- If the product appears cloudy, discoloured or contains particles, or if the injection pen, cartridge or vial appears damaged.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are not sure whether you should start using this medicine, talk to your doctor.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not give Apidra to children less than 4 years of age.</strong> There is no experience with the use of Apidra in children less than 4 years.</p>
<h3><em>Before you start to use Apidra</em></h3>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you have allergies to any other medicines, foods, preservatives or dyes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you have or have had any of the following medical conditions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>kidney problems</strong></li>
<li><strong>liver problems</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</strong> Pregnancy may make managing your diabetes more difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>you drink alcohol</strong></li>
<li><strong>you do not eat regular meals</strong></li>
<li><strong>you do a lot of exercise</strong></li>
<li><strong>you are ill or feeling unwell</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Alcohol, diet, exercise and your general health all affect the control of your diabetes.</p>
<p><strong>If you have not told your doctor about any of the above, tell them before you start using Apidra.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Taking other medicines</em></h3>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines, including any that you get without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.</strong></p>
<p>Medicines that may increase the blood sugar lowering effect of Apidra include:</p>
<ul>
<li>oral antidiabetic medicines that are used to treat type 2 diabetes</li>
<li>blood pressure, blood flow, cholesterol and heart medications</li>
<li>medications for pain and inflammation</li>
<li>some antidepressants</li>
<li>sulfonamide antibiotics</li>
</ul>
<p>Medicines that may reduce the blood sugar lowering effect of Apidra include:</p>
<ul>
<li>corticosteroids, glucagon and other hormonal therapies</li>
<li>oral contraceptives and gynaecological medications</li>
<li>fluid and glaucoma medications</li>
<li>tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS treatments</li>
<li>some psychiatric medications</li>
<li>adrenaline (epinephrine) and asthma medications such as salbutamol, terbutaline</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain heart medications, especially beta-blockers, may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia.</p>
<p>Your doctor and pharmacist have a full list of medicines with which you must be careful or avoid while using Apidra. Please check with your doctor or pharmacist before starting any new medicines or over the counter products.</p>
<h2>How to use Apidra</h2>
<p>Your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes educator will have shown you how to use Apidra.</p>
<p>Carefully follow all the directions.</p>
<p><strong>Do not inject Apidra into a vein.</strong> Apidra is intended for injection under the skin.</p>
<p><strong>Any change in this medicine should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you do not understand the instructions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes educator for help.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How much to use</em></h3>
<p>Your doctor will tell you how much Apidra you need to use each day. Your doctor may increase or decrease the dose, depending on your blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>It is very important that you manage your diabetes carefully. Too much or too little insulin can cause serious effects.</p>
<h3><em>When to use Apidra</em></h3>
<p>Your doctor will tell you when to use Apidra.</p>
<p><strong>Apidra should be used within 15 minutes before or immediately after a meal.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How to use Apidra</em></h3>
<p><strong>ALWAYS CHECK YOUR APIDRA INJECTION PEN, CARTRIDGE OR VIAL.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not use Apidra if it is no longer clear and colourless or if it contains particles.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Make sure you are using the correct injection pen, cartridge or vial.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Always check the insulin label on the SoloStar pen, cartridge or vial before each injection to make sure you are using the right insulin.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keep the injection pen, cartridge or vial at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before use. Cold insulin is more painful to inject.</strong></p>
<h3><em>For Apidra injection pens or cartridges</em></h3>
<p><strong>PREPARING A DOSE FOR INJECTION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Always do a safety test before use.</strong> The safety test may highlight a problem with your injection pen. The safety test also removes any air bubbles and helps indicate whether or not a needle is bent or broken.</p>
<p>Becton Dickinson (BD Micro-Fine™+) needles should be used with injection pens.</p>
<h3><em>Reusable pens</em></h3>
<p><strong>We recommend that Apidra cartridges only be used with the AllStar, AllStar Pro, JuniorStar or ClikStar reusable pen.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Carefully follow the instructions provided with the pen, for loading a cartridge, attaching a needle, performing a safety test and administering the insulin injection.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If the reusable injection pen does not work properly, Apidra may be withdrawn from the cartridge into a syringe. Ask your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes educator for help.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Pre-filled disposable pens</em></h3>
<p><strong>Apidra SoloStar disposable pens are pre-filled and ready for use. Once all the insulin is used, you cannot replace the cartridge.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Carefully follow the instructions provided with the Apidra SoloStar pen for attaching a needle, performing a safety test and administering the insulin injection.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Never use an injection pen if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. Use a new pen.</strong></p>
<p><strong>INJECTING A DOSE</strong></p>
<p>Apidra should be injected under the skin, being careful not to inject it into a muscle or vein.</p>
<p><strong>Choose a site for injection.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Inject Apidra into the abdomen, thighs or upper arms.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>With one hand, stabilise the skin by spreading it or pinching up a large area, as recommended by your healthcare professional.</li>
<li>Insert the needle into the skin as recommended by your healthcare professional.</li>
<li>Inject the full dose of Apidra by pushing the plunger as far as it will go.</li>
<li>Slowly count to 10 before removing the needle from the skin.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Use a different injection site each injection so that the same site is not used more often than once a month.</strong>This will reduce the chance of local skin reactions developing.</p>
<p><strong>AFTER INJECTING</strong></p>
<p><strong>Using the outer needle cap, unscrew the needle and dispose of it safely into a sharps container.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not share needles, cartridges or injection devices. Do not reuse needles.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Leave the cartridge in the pen until it needs to be replaced.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not attempt to replace the cartridge in a pre-filled disposable pen.</strong> Empty disposable pens must never be reused and must be properly discarded.</p>
<h3><em>For Apidra vials</em></h3>
<p><strong>PREPARING A DOSE FOR INJECTION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Using one insulin type (Apidra)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Wash your hands.</li>
<li>Draw air into a U100 insulin syringe equal to the dose of Apidra to be injected.</li>
<li>Push the needle through the rubber top of the vial and inject the air into the vial.</li>
<li>Leave the needle in the vial. Hold the vial and syringe firmly in one hand, with the vial above the syringe.</li>
<li>Make sure the tip of the needle is in the insulin and withdraw the correct dose into the syringe.</li>
<li>Before removing the needle from the vial, check the syringe for air bubbles. If bubbles are present, hold the syringe vertically (needle pointed upwards) and tap firmly until the bubbles float to the top. Push the bubbles out with the plunger and then withdraw the correct dose. Remove the needle from the vial.</li>
<li>If you need to put the syringe down, make sure the needle does not touch anything.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Mixing Apidra with NPH (isophane) insulin</strong></p>
<p><strong>Only mix Apidra with another insulin if your doctor has instructed you to do so.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not mix Apidra with insulins other than NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) insulin.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Draw Apidra into the syringe first, then NPH insulin.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Wash your hands</li>
<li>Just before use, roll the vial of cloudy (longer acting) NPH insulin between your hands until the liquid is white and uniformly cloudy. Do not shake the vial.</li>
<li>Draw air into a U100 insulin syringe equal to the dose of cloudy NPH insulin you are using. Put the needle through the rubber top of the NPH insulin vial and inject air into the vial. Withdraw the needle without drawing up any insulin.</li>
<li>Draw air into the syringe equal to your dose of Apidra and inject it into the Apidra vial but do not withdraw the needle.</li>
<li>Leave the needle in the vial. Hold the vial and syringe firmly in one hand, with the vial above the syringe.</li>
<li>Make sure the tip of the needle is in the Apidra and withdraw the correct dose into the syringe.</li>
<li>Pull the needle out of the Apidra vial. Expel any air from the syringe and check that the dose is correct.</li>
<li>Insert the needle into the vial of cloudy NPH insulin.</li>
<li>Leave the needle in the vial. Hold the vial and syringe firmly in one hand, with the vial above the syringe.</li>
<li>Make sure the tip of the needle is in the insulin and withdraw your dose of cloudy NPH insulin.</li>
<li>Remove the needle from the vial.</li>
<li>If you need to put the syringe down for a brief moment, make sure the needle does not touch anything.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>INJECTING A DOSE</strong></p>
<p>Apidra should be injected under the skin, being careful not to inject it into a muscle or vein.</p>
<p><strong>Choose a site for injection.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Inject Apidra into the abdomen, thighs or upper arms.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Apidra mixed with NPH insulin should be injected immediately after mixing.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>With one hand, stabilise the skin by spreading it or pinching up a large area, as recommended by your healthcare professional.</li>
<li>Insert the needle into the skin as recommended by your healthcare professional.</li>
<li>Inject the full dose of Apidra, or Apidra mixed with NPH insulin, by pushing the plunger as far as it will go.</li>
<li>Slowly count to 10 before removing the needle from the skin.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Use a different injection site each injection so the same site is not used more often than once a month.</strong> This will reduce the chance of local skin reactions developing.</p>
<p><strong>AFTER INJECTING</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dispose of your insulin syringes safely into a sharps container.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not share vials, needles or syringes. Do not reuse needles.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How long to use Apidra</em></h3>
<p><strong>Continue using Apidra for as long as your doctor recommends.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Make sure you keep enough Apidra to last over weekends and holidays.</strong></p>
<h3><em>If you take too much (overdose) - Hypoglycaemia, a ""Hypo""</em></h3>
<p>If you accidentally use too much Apidra your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).</p>
<p><strong>Immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (13 11 26 in Australia; 0800 POISON or 0800 764 766 in New Zealand) if you think that you or anyone else may have used too much Apidra.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.</strong></p>
<p>The risk of hypoglycaemia is increased if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>accidentally use too much Apidra</li>
<li>have too much or unexpected exercise</li>
<li>delay eating meals or snacks</li>
<li>eat too little food</li>
<li>are ill</li>
</ul>
<p>The first symptoms of mild to moderate hypoglycaemia can come on suddenly. They may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>cold sweat, cool pale skin</li>
<li>fatigue, drowsiness, unusual tiredness and weakness</li>
<li>nervousness, anxious feeling, tremor, rapid heart beat</li>
<li>confusion, difficulty concentrating</li>
<li>excessive hunger</li>
<li>vision changes</li>
<li>headache, nausea</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Always carry some sugary food or drink with you.</strong></p>
<p>If you experience any of these symptoms of hypoglycaemia, you need to raise your blood sugar urgently. You can do this by taking one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>5-7 jelly beans</li>
<li>3 teaspoons of sugar or honey</li>
<li>1/2 can of a sugar-containing soft drink (not a diet soft drink)</li>
<li>2-3 concentrated glucose tablets</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Follow up with extra carbohydrates, e.g. plain biscuits, fruit or milk, when over the initial symptoms.</strong> Taking this extra carbohydrate will prevent a second drop in your blood sugar level.</p>
<p>If not treated quickly, the initial symptoms of hypoglycaemia may progress to loss of co-ordination, slurred speech, confusion, loss of consciousness and seizures.</p>
<p>If severe hypoglycaemia is not treated, it can cause brain damage and death.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your relatives, friends, close workmates or carers that you have diabetes.</strong> It is important that they recognise the signs and symptoms of a ""hypo"".</p>
<p><strong>Make sure they know to turn you on your side and get medical help immediately if you lose consciousness.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Make sure they know not to give you anything to eat or drink if you are unconscious.</strong> This is because you could choke.</p>
<p><strong>Provide them with the telephone number for your doctor, the Poisons Information Centre (13 11 26 in Australia; 0800 POISON or 0800 764 766 in New Zealand) and Emergency Services.</strong></p>
<p>An injection of the hormone glucagon may speed up recovery from unconsciousness. This can be given by a relative, friend, workmate or carer who knows how to give it.</p>
<p>If glucagon is used, have some sugary food or drink as soon as you are conscious again.</p>
<p>If you do not feel better after this, contact your doctor, diabetes educator, or the closest hospital.</p>
<p>If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>See your doctor if you keep having ""hypos"", or if you have ever become unconscious after using Apidra.</strong> Your dose of Apidra or other medicines may need to be changed.</p>
<p>If severe hypoglycaemia is not treated, it can cause brain damage and death.</p>
<h3><em>If you miss a dose - Hyperglycaemia</em></h3>
<p><strong>If you forget to take your insulin dose check your blood sugar level as soon as possible.</strong> Your blood sugar level may become high (hyperglycaemia).</p>
<p><strong>Do not take an extra dose at a later time just because you have missed a dose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you miss taking your dose at the regular scheduled time, taking a dose at another time can increase your risk of having a hypo. You should therefore plan in advance with your doctor or healthcare professional so that you know what to do in case you miss a dose.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have missed a dose and are not sure what to do, contact your doctor or healthcare professional for specific advice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do NOT use a double dose of your insulin.</strong> If you double a dose, this may cause low blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>The risk of hyperglycaemia is increased if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>miss doses of Apidra or other insulins, or use less Apidra than you need</li>
<li>have uncontrolled diabetes</li>
<li>exercise less than usual</li>
<li>eat more carbohydrates than usual</li>
<li>are ill or stressed</li>
<li>take certain other medicines</li>
</ul>
<p>High blood sugar levels over a period of time can lead to too much acid in the blood (diabetic ketoacidosis).</p>
<p><strong>Contact your doctor immediately if your blood sugar level is very high or you experience any of the following symptoms.</strong></p>
<p>Symptoms of mild to moderate hyperglycaemia include:</p>
<ul>
<li>drowsy feeling</li>
<li>flushed face</li>
<li>thirst, loss of appetite</li>
<li>fruity odour on the breath</li>
<li>blurred vision</li>
<li>passing larger amounts of urine than usual</li>
<li>getting up at night more often than usual to pass urine</li>
<li>high levels of glucose and acetone in the urine</li>
</ul>
<p>Symptoms of severe hyperglycaemia include:</p>
<ul>
<li>heavy breathing</li>
<li>fast pulse</li>
<li>nausea, vomiting</li>
<li>dehydration</li>
<li>loss of consciousness</li>
</ul>
<p>Severe hyperglycaemia can lead to unconsciousness and, in extreme cases, death if untreated.</p>
<p><strong>Discuss any worries you may have about this with your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes educator.</strong></p>
<h2>While you are using Apidra</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Measure your blood sugar level regularly.</strong> This is the best way to tell if your diabetes is being controlled properly. Your doctor or diabetes educator will show you how and when to do this.</p>
<p><strong>It is important to keep using Apidra even if you feel well.</strong></p>
<p>Apidra helps to control your condition, but does not cure it.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you often have hypoglycaemia or if you have ever become unconscious after using Apidra.</strong>Your doctor may need to adjust your dose of Apidra or of other medicines you are taking.</p>
<p><strong>Always carry some sugary food or drink with you.</strong> If you experience any of the symptoms of hypoglycaemia, immediately eat some sugary food or have a drink, e.g. jelly beans, sugar, honey, sugar-containing soft drink, glucose tablets. Diet and low calorie soft drinks do NOT contain sugar and are unsuitable to take for hypoglycaemia.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure that you tell every doctor, dentist, pharmacist or other healthcare professional who is treating you that you have diabetes and are using Apidra.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes educator if you are travelling.</strong> Ask your doctor for a letter explaining why you are taking injecting pens and needles with you.</p>
<p>Each country you visit will need to see this letter, so you should take several copies.</p>
<p>You may need to inject Apidra and eat your meals at different times because of time differences in and between countries.</p>
<p>If you are travelling, it is a good idea to:</p>
<ul>
<li>wear some form of identification showing you have diabetes</li>
<li>carry some form of sugar to treat hypoglycaemia if it occurs, e.g. sugar sachets or jelly beans</li>
<li>carry emergency food rations in case of a delay, e.g. dried fruit, biscuits or muesli bars</li>
<li>keep Apidra readily available; take enough Apidra for your expected needs whilst travelling - you may not be able to get Apidra in the country you are visiting</li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes educator can provide you with some helpful information.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you are having trouble or difficulty with your eyesight.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Visit your doctor for regular checks of your eyes, feet, kidneys, heart, circulation, blood and blood pressure.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Carefully follow your doctor's and/or dietician's advice on diet, drinking alcohol and exercise.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not stop using Apidra unless your doctor tells you to.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not skip meals while using Apidra.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not use Apidra if you think it has been frozen or exposed to excessive heat (temperatures above 25°C).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not re-use empty cartridges.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not give Apidra to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things to be careful of</em></h3>
<p><strong>Be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how Apidra affects you. Be careful not to let your blood sugar levels fall too low.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you drink alcohol.</strong> Alcohol may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you are ill.</strong> Illness, especially with nausea and vomiting, may cause your insulin needs to change. Even if you are not eating, you still require insulin. You and your doctor should design an insulin plan for those times when you are sick.</p>
<p><strong>If you become sick with a cold or flu, it is very important to continue using Apidra, even if you feel unable to eat your normal meal. If you have trouble eating solid foods, use sugar-sweetened drinks as a carbohydrate substitute or eat small amounts of bland food.</strong> Your diabetes educator or dietician can give you a list of foods to use for sick days.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you are exercising more than usual.</strong> Exercise may lower your need for Apidra. Exercise may also speed up the effect of a dose of Apidra, especially if the exercise involves the area of the injection site (e.g. the leg should not be used for injection prior to jogging or running).</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if your diet changes.</strong> Changes in diet may cause your insulin needs to change.</p>
<h2>Side effects</h2>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes educator as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are using Apidra.</strong></p>
<p>Apidra helps most people with diabetes, but it may have unwanted side effects in a few people. All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical attention if you get some of the side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Do not be alarmed by the following lists of side effects. You may not experience any of them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes educator to answer any questions you may have.</strong></p>
<p>The most common side effect when using insulin is low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia - a ""hypo"").</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you notice any of the following and they worry you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>hypoglycaemia (mild to moderate)</li>
<li>redness, swelling or itching at the injection site; usually these symptoms disappear within a few weeks during continued use</li>
<li>a depression or thickening of the skin around the injection site (lipodystrophy); this can often occur if you inject too often at the same injection site</li>
</ul>
<p>The above list includes the more common side effects of your medicine. They are usually mild and short-lived.</p>
<p><strong>If any of the following happen, tell your doctor immediately or go to Accident and Emergency at your nearest hospital:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- More severe symptoms of hypoglycaemia, including:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>disorientation</li>
<li>seizures, fits or convulsions</li>
<li>loss of consciousness</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>- Signs of a serious allergic reaction, including:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>skin rashes over a large part of the body</li>
<li>shortness of breath, wheezing</li>
<li>swelling of the face, lips or tongue</li>
<li>fast pulse</li>
<li>sweating</li>
</ul>
<p>The above list includes some very serious side effects. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation. These side effects are very rare.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you notice anything that is making you feel unwell.</strong></p>
<p>Other side effects not listed above may also occur in some people.</p>
<h2>After using Apidra</h2>
<h3><em>Storage</em></h3>
<p><strong>All medicines should be kept where children cannot reach them.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Keep unopened cartridges of Apidra in a refrigerator where the temperature is between 2-8°C. Do not allow it to freeze. Discard if frozen.</strong></p>
<p>When the cartridge has been inserted in the injection pen, the cartridge-pen combination should not be put in the refrigerator and should be kept below 25°C. Do not leave it near heat or in direct light. Discard the cartridge within 28 days of first use. Cartridges that are first carried as a spare for a while must also be discarded 28 days after being removed from the refrigerator.</p>
<p><strong>PRE-FILLED DISPOSABLE PENS<br/>
Before use, keep unopened Apidra pre-filled pens in a refrigerator where the temperature is between 2-8°C. Do not allow to freeze. Discard if frozen.</strong></p>
<p>Before first use, store the pre-filled pen at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours. Once in use, the pre-filled pen should not be put in the refrigerator and it should be kept below 25°C. Do not leave it near heat or in direct light. Discard the pre-filled pen within 28 days of first use. Pre-filled pens that are first carried as a spare for a while must also be discarded 28 days after being removed from the refrigerator.</p>
<p><strong>VIALS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keep Apidra in a refrigerator where the temperature is between 2-8°C. Do not allow it to freeze. Discard if frozen.</strong></p>
<p>Once opened, the vial should be refrigerated between 2-8°C, but may be kept unrefrigerated for up to 28 days as long as it is kept below 25°C. Do not leave it near heat or in direct light. Discard the vial within 28 days of first use. Vials that are first carried as a spare for a while must also be discarded 28 days after being removed from the refrigerator.</p>
<h3><em>Disposal</em></h3>
<p><strong>Dispose of your needles and disposable injection devices safely into a sharps container.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If your doctor tells you to stop using Apidra or the expiry date has passed, ask your pharmacist what to do with any medicine that is left over.</strong></p>

Consumer Medicine Information
What is in this leaflet
This leaflet answers some common questions about Apidra.
It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes educator.
All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you using Apidra against the benefits they expect it will have for you.
If you have any concerns about using this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Keep this leaflet with the medicine. You may need to read it again.
What Apidra is used for
Apidra is used to reduce high blood sugar (glucose) levels in people with diabetes mellitus.
Apidra is a modified insulin that is very similar to human insulin. It is a substitute for the insulin produced by the pancreas.
Apidra is a short-acting insulin. Your doctor may tell you to use a long-acting insulin in combination with Apidra.
Apidra is not addictive.
Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why Apidra has been prescribed for you.
Before you use Apidra
When you must not use Apidra
Do not use Apidra:
- If you have an allergy to:

any medicine containing insulin
any of the ingredients contained in Apidra listed at the end of this leaflet

Some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction may include:

redness, swelling, rash and itching at the injection site
rash, itching or hives on the skin
shortness of breath
wheezing or difficulty breathing
swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body

- If you are experiencing low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia - a ""hypo""). 
If you have a lot of hypos discuss appropriate treatment with your doctor.
- After the expiry date printed on the pack or if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering. 
If you use Apidra after the expiry date has passed, it may not work as well. If it has expired or is damaged, return it to your pharmacist for disposal.
- If the product appears cloudy, discoloured or contains particles, or if the injection pen, cartridge or vial appears damaged.
If you are not sure whether you should start using this medicine, talk to your doctor.
Do not give Apidra to children less than 4 years of age. There is no experience with the use of Apidra in children less than 4 years.
Before you start to use Apidra
Tell your doctor if you have allergies to any other medicines, foods, preservatives or dyes.
Tell your doctor if you have or have had any of the following medical conditions:

kidney problems
liver problems

Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Pregnancy may make managing your diabetes more difficult.
Tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.
Tell your doctor if:

you drink alcohol
you do not eat regular meals
you do a lot of exercise
you are ill or feeling unwell

Alcohol, diet, exercise and your general health all affect the control of your diabetes.
If you have not told your doctor about any of the above, tell them before you start using Apidra.
Taking other medicines
Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines, including any that you get without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.
Medicines that may increase the blood sugar lowering effect of Apidra include:

oral antidiabetic medicines that are used to treat type 2 diabetes
blood pressure, blood flow, cholesterol and heart medications
medications for pain and inflammation
some antidepressants
sulfonamide antibiotics

Medicines that may reduce the blood sugar lowering effect of Apidra include:

corticosteroids, glucagon and other hormonal therapies
oral contraceptives and gynaecological medications
fluid and glaucoma medications
tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS treatments
some psychiatric medications
adrenaline (epinephrine) and asthma medications such as salbutamol, terbutaline

Certain heart medications, especially beta-blockers, may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia.
Your doctor and pharmacist have a full list of medicines with which you must be careful or avoid while using Apidra. Please check with your doctor or pharmacist before starting any new medicines or over the counter products.
How to use Apidra
Your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes educator will have shown you how to use Apidra.
Carefully follow all the directions.
Do not inject Apidra into a vein. Apidra is intended for injection under the skin.
Any change in this medicine should be made cautiously and only under medical supervision.
If you do not understand the instructions, ask your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes educator for help.
How much to use
Your doctor will tell you how much Apidra you need to use each day. Your doctor may increase or decrease the dose, depending on your blood sugar levels.
It is very important that you manage your diabetes carefully. Too much or too little insulin can cause serious effects.
When to use Apidra
Your doctor will tell you when to use Apidra.
Apidra should be used within 15 minutes before or immediately after a meal.
How to use Apidra
ALWAYS CHECK YOUR APIDRA INJECTION PEN, CARTRIDGE OR VIAL.
Do not use Apidra if it is no longer clear and colourless or if it contains particles.
Make sure you are using the correct injection pen, cartridge or vial.
Always check the insulin label on the SoloStar pen, cartridge or vial before each injection to make sure you are using the right insulin.
Keep the injection pen, cartridge or vial at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before use. Cold insulin is more painful to inject.
For Apidra injection pens or cartridges
PREPARING A DOSE FOR INJECTION
Always do a safety test before use. The safety test may highlight a problem with your injection pen. The safety test also removes any air bubbles and helps indicate whether or not a needle is bent or broken.
Becton Dickinson (BD Micro-Fine™+) needles should be used with injection pens.
Reusable pens
We recommend that Apidra cartridges only be used with the AllStar, AllStar Pro, JuniorStar or ClikStar reusable pen.
Carefully follow the instructions provided with the pen, for loading a cartridge, attaching a needle, performing a safety test and administering the insulin injection.
If the reusable injection pen does not work properly, Apidra may be withdrawn from the cartridge into a syringe. Ask your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes educator for help.
Pre-filled disposable pens
Apidra SoloStar disposable pens are pre-filled and ready for use. Once all the insulin is used, you cannot replace the cartridge.
Carefully follow the instructions provided with the Apidra SoloStar pen for attaching a needle, performing a safety test and administering the insulin injection.
Never use an injection pen if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly. Use a new pen.
INJECTING A DOSE
Apidra should be injected under the skin, being careful not to inject it into a muscle or vein.
Choose a site for injection.
Inject Apidra into the abdomen, thighs or upper arms.

With one hand, stabilise the skin by spreading it or pinching up a large area, as recommended by your healthcare professional.
Insert the needle into the skin as recommended by your healthcare professional.
Inject the full dose of Apidra by pushing the plunger as far as it will go.
Slowly count to 10 before removing the needle from the skin.

Use a different injection site each injection so that the same site is not used more often than once a month.This will reduce the chance of local skin reactions developing.
AFTER INJECTING
Using the outer needle cap, unscrew the needle and dispose of it safely into a sharps container.
Do not share needles, cartridges or injection devices. Do not reuse needles.
Leave the cartridge in the pen until it needs to be replaced.
Do not attempt to replace the cartridge in a pre-filled disposable pen. Empty disposable pens must never be reused and must be properly discarded.
For Apidra vials
PREPARING A DOSE FOR INJECTION
Using one insulin type (Apidra)

Wash your hands.
Draw air into a U100 insulin syringe equal to the dose of Apidra to be injected.
Push the needle through the rubber top of the vial and inject the air into the vial.
Leave the needle in the vial. Hold the vial and syringe firmly in one hand, with the vial above the syringe.
Make sure the tip of the needle is in the insulin and withdraw the correct dose into the syringe.
Before removing the needle from the vial, check the syringe for air bubbles. If bubbles are present, hold the syringe vertically (needle pointed upwards) and tap firmly until the bubbles float to the top. Push the bubbles out with the plunger and then withdraw the correct dose. Remove the needle from the vial.
If you need to put the syringe down, make sure the needle does not touch anything.

Mixing Apidra with NPH (isophane) insulin
Only mix Apidra with another insulin if your doctor has instructed you to do so.
Do not mix Apidra with insulins other than NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) insulin.
Draw Apidra into the syringe first, then NPH insulin.

Wash your hands
Just before use, roll the vial of cloudy (longer acting) NPH insulin between your hands until the liquid is white and uniformly cloudy. Do not shake the vial.
Draw air into a U100 insulin syringe equal to the dose of cloudy NPH insulin you are using. Put the needle through the rubber top of the NPH insulin vial and inject air into the vial. Withdraw the needle without drawing up any insulin.
Draw air into the syringe equal to your dose of Apidra and inject it into the Apidra vial but do not withdraw the needle.
Leave the needle in the vial. Hold the vial and syringe firmly in one hand, with the vial above the syringe.
Make sure the tip of the needle is in the Apidra and withdraw the correct dose into the syringe.
Pull the needle out of the Apidra vial. Expel any air from the syringe and check that the dose is correct.
Insert the needle into the vial of cloudy NPH insulin.
Leave the needle in the vial. Hold the vial and syringe firmly in one hand, with the vial above the syringe.
Make sure the tip of the needle is in the insulin and withdraw your dose of cloudy NPH insulin.
Remove the needle from the vial.
If you need to put the syringe down for a brief moment, make sure the needle does not touch anything.

INJECTING A DOSE
Apidra should be injected under the skin, being careful not to inject it into a muscle or vein.
Choose a site for injection.
Inject Apidra into the abdomen, thighs or upper arms.
Apidra mixed with NPH insulin should be injected immediately after mixing.

With one hand, stabilise the skin by spreading it or pinching up a large area, as recommended by your healthcare professional.
Insert the needle into the skin as recommended by your healthcare professional.
Inject the full dose of Apidra, or Apidra mixed with NPH insulin, by pushing the plunger as far as it will go.
Slowly count to 10 before removing the needle from the skin.

Use a different injection site each injection so the same site is not used more often than once a month. This will reduce the chance of local skin reactions developing.
AFTER INJECTING
Dispose of your insulin syringes safely into a sharps container.
Do not share vials, needles or syringes. Do not reuse needles.
How long to use Apidra
Continue using Apidra for as long as your doctor recommends.
Make sure you keep enough Apidra to last over weekends and holidays.
If you take too much (overdose) - Hypoglycaemia, a ""Hypo""
If you accidentally use too much Apidra your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).
Immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (13 11 26 in Australia; 0800 POISON or 0800 764 766 in New Zealand) if you think that you or anyone else may have used too much Apidra.
Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.
The risk of hypoglycaemia is increased if you:

accidentally use too much Apidra
have too much or unexpected exercise
delay eating meals or snacks
eat too little food
are ill

The first symptoms of mild to moderate hypoglycaemia can come on suddenly. They may include:

cold sweat, cool pale skin
fatigue, drowsiness, unusual tiredness and weakness
nervousness, anxious feeling, tremor, rapid heart beat
confusion, difficulty concentrating
excessive hunger
vision changes
headache, nausea

Always carry some sugary food or drink with you.
If you experience any of these symptoms of hypoglycaemia, you need to raise your blood sugar urgently. You can do this by taking one of the following:

5-7 jelly beans
3 teaspoons of sugar or honey
1/2 can of a sugar-containing soft drink (not a diet soft drink)
2-3 concentrated glucose tablets

Follow up with extra carbohydrates, e.g. plain biscuits, fruit or milk, when over the initial symptoms. Taking this extra carbohydrate will prevent a second drop in your blood sugar level.
If not treated quickly, the initial symptoms of hypoglycaemia may progress to loss of co-ordination, slurred speech, confusion, loss of consciousness and seizures.
If severe hypoglycaemia is not treated, it can cause brain damage and death.
Tell your relatives, friends, close workmates or carers that you have diabetes. It is important that they recognise the signs and symptoms of a ""hypo"".
Make sure they know to turn you on your side and get medical help immediately if you lose consciousness.
Make sure they know not to give you anything to eat or drink if you are unconscious. This is because you could choke.
Provide them with the telephone number for your doctor, the Poisons Information Centre (13 11 26 in Australia; 0800 POISON or 0800 764 766 in New Zealand) and Emergency Services.
An injection of the hormone glucagon may speed up recovery from unconsciousness. This can be given by a relative, friend, workmate or carer who knows how to give it.
If glucagon is used, have some sugary food or drink as soon as you are conscious again.
If you do not feel better after this, contact your doctor, diabetes educator, or the closest hospital.
If you do not respond to glucagon treatment, you will have to be treated in a hospital.
See your doctor if you keep having ""hypos"", or if you have ever become unconscious after using Apidra. Your dose of Apidra or other medicines may need to be changed.
If severe hypoglycaemia is not treated, it can cause brain damage and death.
If you miss a dose - Hyperglycaemia
If you forget to take your insulin dose check your blood sugar level as soon as possible. Your blood sugar level may become high (hyperglycaemia).
Do not take an extra dose at a later time just because you have missed a dose.
If you miss taking your dose at the regular scheduled time, taking a dose at another time can increase your risk of having a hypo. You should therefore plan in advance with your doctor or healthcare professional so that you know what to do in case you miss a dose.
If you have missed a dose and are not sure what to do, contact your doctor or healthcare professional for specific advice.
Do NOT use a double dose of your insulin. If you double a dose, this may cause low blood sugar levels.
The risk of hyperglycaemia is increased if you:

miss doses of Apidra or other insulins, or use less Apidra than you need
have uncontrolled diabetes
exercise less than usual
eat more carbohydrates than usual
are ill or stressed
take certain other medicines

High blood sugar levels over a period of time can lead to too much acid in the blood (diabetic ketoacidosis).
Contact your doctor immediately if your blood sugar level is very high or you experience any of the following symptoms.
Symptoms of mild to moderate hyperglycaemia include:

drowsy feeling
flushed face
thirst, loss of appetite
fruity odour on the breath
blurred vision
passing larger amounts of urine than usual
getting up at night more often than usual to pass urine
high levels of glucose and acetone in the urine

Symptoms of severe hyperglycaemia include:

heavy breathing
fast pulse
nausea, vomiting
dehydration
loss of consciousness

Severe hyperglycaemia can lead to unconsciousness and, in extreme cases, death if untreated.
Discuss any worries you may have about this with your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes educator.
While you are using Apidra
Things you must do
Measure your blood sugar level regularly. This is the best way to tell if your diabetes is being controlled properly. Your doctor or diabetes educator will show you how and when to do this.
It is important to keep using Apidra even if you feel well.
Apidra helps to control your condition, but does not cure it.
Tell your doctor if you often have hypoglycaemia or if you have ever become unconscious after using Apidra.Your doctor may need to adjust your dose of Apidra or of other medicines you are taking.
Always carry some sugary food or drink with you. If you experience any of the symptoms of hypoglycaemia, immediately eat some sugary food or have a drink, e.g. jelly beans, sugar, honey, sugar-containing soft drink, glucose tablets. Diet and low calorie soft drinks do NOT contain sugar and are unsuitable to take for hypoglycaemia.
Make sure that you tell every doctor, dentist, pharmacist or other healthcare professional who is treating you that you have diabetes and are using Apidra.
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes educator if you are travelling. Ask your doctor for a letter explaining why you are taking injecting pens and needles with you.
Each country you visit will need to see this letter, so you should take several copies.
You may need to inject Apidra and eat your meals at different times because of time differences in and between countries.
If you are travelling, it is a good idea to:

wear some form of identification showing you have diabetes
carry some form of sugar to treat hypoglycaemia if it occurs, e.g. sugar sachets or jelly beans
carry emergency food rations in case of a delay, e.g. dried fruit, biscuits or muesli bars
keep Apidra readily available; take enough Apidra for your expected needs whilst travelling - you may not be able to get Apidra in the country you are visiting

Your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes educator can provide you with some helpful information.
Tell your doctor if you are having trouble or difficulty with your eyesight.
Visit your doctor for regular checks of your eyes, feet, kidneys, heart, circulation, blood and blood pressure.
Carefully follow your doctor's and/or dietician's advice on diet, drinking alcohol and exercise.
Things you must not do
Do not stop using Apidra unless your doctor tells you to.
Do not skip meals while using Apidra.
Do not use Apidra if you think it has been frozen or exposed to excessive heat (temperatures above 25°C).
Do not re-use empty cartridges.
Do not give Apidra to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.
Things to be careful of
Be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how Apidra affects you. Be careful not to let your blood sugar levels fall too low.
Tell your doctor if you drink alcohol. Alcohol may mask the symptoms of hypoglycaemia.
Tell your doctor if you are ill. Illness, especially with nausea and vomiting, may cause your insulin needs to change. Even if you are not eating, you still require insulin. You and your doctor should design an insulin plan for those times when you are sick.
If you become sick with a cold or flu, it is very important to continue using Apidra, even if you feel unable to eat your normal meal. If you have trouble eating solid foods, use sugar-sweetened drinks as a carbohydrate substitute or eat small amounts of bland food. Your diabetes educator or dietician can give you a list of foods to use for sick days.
Tell your doctor if you are exercising more than usual. Exercise may lower your need for Apidra. Exercise may also speed up the effect of a dose of Apidra, especially if the exercise involves the area of the injection site (e.g. the leg should not be used for injection prior to jogging or running).
Tell your doctor if your diet changes. Changes in diet may cause your insulin needs to change.
Side effects
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes educator as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are using Apidra.
Apidra helps most people with diabetes, but it may have unwanted side effects in a few people. All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical attention if you get some of the side effects.
Do not be alarmed by the following lists of side effects. You may not experience any of them.
Ask your doctor, pharmacist or diabetes educator to answer any questions you may have.
The most common side effect when using insulin is low blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia - a ""hypo"").
Tell your doctor if you notice any of the following and they worry you:

hypoglycaemia (mild to moderate)
redness, swelling or itching at the injection site; usually these symptoms disappear within a few weeks during continued use
a depression or thickening of the skin around the injection site (lipodystrophy); this can often occur if you inject too often at the same injection site

The above list includes the more common side effects of your medicine. They are usually mild and short-lived.
If any of the following happen, tell your doctor immediately or go to Accident and Emergency at your nearest hospital:
- More severe symptoms of hypoglycaemia, including:

disorientation
seizures, fits or convulsions
loss of consciousness

- Signs of a serious allergic reaction, including:

skin rashes over a large part of the body
shortness of breath, wheezing
swelling of the face, lips or tongue
fast pulse
sweating

The above list includes some very serious side effects. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation. These side effects are very rare.
Tell your doctor if you notice anything that is making you feel unwell.
Other side effects not listed above may also occur in some people.
After using Apidra

<h2>How to take this medicine</h2>
<p>Follow carefully all directions given to you by your doctor. Their instructions may be different to the information in this leaflet.</p>
<h3><em>How much to take</em></h3>
<p>Your doctor will tell you how much of this medicine you should take. This will depend on your condition and whether you are taking any other medicines.</p>
<p><strong>For high blood pressure</strong> <br/>
The usual starting dose is one 40 mg tablet taken twice a day for one week.</p>
<p>The dose is then usually increased to between 120 mg to 320 mg daily.</p>
<p>If you are taking other medicines which lower blood pressure, your doctor may need to change the dose of them to obtain the best results for you.</p>
<p><strong>For angina and tremor</strong> <br/>
The usual dose is 80 mg taken twice a day, often starting with 40 mg taken four times a day for 2 or 3 days.</p>
<p><strong>For migraine prevention</strong></p>
<p><strong>Adults</strong> <br/>
The usual dose is 40 mg taken twice a day. This may need to be increased up to 80 mg twice a day.</p>
<p><strong>Children over 7 years</strong> <br/>
The starting dose is 10 mg taken once or twice daily. This can be increased if necessary.</p>
<p>Do not stop taking your medicine or change your dosage without first checking with your doctor.</p>
<h3><em>How to take it</em></h3>
<p>Take tablet with a glass of water.</p>
<h3><em>When to take it</em></h3>
<p>Take this medicine at the same time each day. Taking it at the same time each day will have the best effect and will also help you remember when to take it.</p>
<p>It does not matter if you take it before, with or after food.</p>
<h3><em>How long to take it for</em></h3>
<p>Continue taking your medicine for as long as your doctor tells you.</p>
<p>Make sure you have enough to last over weekends and holidays.</p>
<h3><em>If you forget to take it</em></h3>
<p>If it is almost time to take your next dose, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time. Otherwise, take it as soon as you remember and then go back to taking your medicine as you would normally.</p>
<p><strong>Do not take a double dose to make up for missed doses.</strong></p>
<p>This may increase the chance of you experiencing side effects.</p>
<p>If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints to help you remember.</p>
<h3><em>If you take too much (overdose)</em></h3>
<p><strong>If you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much of this medicine, immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (Tel: 13 11 26 in Australia) for advice. Alternatively, go to the Accident and Emergency department at your nearest hospital.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. You may need urgent medical attention.</strong></p>
<h2>While you are taking this medicine</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p>Tell your doctor that you are taking this medicine if:</p>
<ul>
<li>you are about to be started on any new medicine</li>
<li>you are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant</li>
<li>you are breastfeeding or are planning to breastfeed</li>
<li>you are about to have any blood tests</li>
<li>you are going to have surgery or an anaesthetic or are going into hospital. Your blood pressure may drop suddenly if propranolol hydrochloride interacts with the anaesthetic</li>
<li>you are being treated for diabetes, make sure you check your blood sugar level regularly and report any changes to your doctor. Propranolol hydrochloride may change how well your diabetes is controlled. It may also cover up some of the symptoms of low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) e.g. increased heart rate. It may also increase the time your body takes to recover from low blood sugar. Your doses of diabetic medicines, including insulin, may need to change.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Non-diabetic patients:<br/>
Propranolol hydrochloride may also occasionally cause low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) in non-diabetic patients.</strong></p>
<p>These may include the newly born, toddlers, children, elderly, patients suffering from overdose, patients suffering from chronic liver disease, fasting patients or patients on haemodialysis.</p>
<p>Your doctor may occasionally do tests to make sure the medicine is working and to prevent side effects. Go to your doctor regularly for a check-up.</p>
<p>Tell any other doctors, dentists and pharmacists who are treating you that you take this medicine.</p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Give this medicine to anyone else, even if their symptoms seem similar to yours.</li>
<li>Take your medicine to treat any other condition unless your doctor tells you to.</li>
<li>Stop taking your medicine, or change the dosage, without first checking with your doctor.</li>
</ul>
<h3><em>Things to be careful of</em></h3>
<p>Be careful when driving or operating machinery until you know how this medicine affects you.</p>
<p>Propranolol hydrochloride may cause dizziness, light-headedness, tiredness, or drowsiness in some people. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive a car, operate machinery, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or light-headed.</p>
<p><strong>Be careful drinking alcohol while you are taking propranolol hydrochloride.</strong> Dizziness or light-headedness may be worse. Alcohol can also increase the effects of propranolol hydrochloride.</p>
<p><strong>Dress warmly during cold weather, especially if you will be outside for a long time (for example when playing winter sports).</strong> Propranolol hydrochloride, like other beta-blocker medicines, may make you more sensitive to cold temperatures, especially if you have circulation problems.</p>

<h2>What SIMBRINZA is used for</h2>
<p>Simbrinza is used to lower pressure in the eye and to treat open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.</p>
<p>Glaucoma is a condition in which the pressure of fluid in the eye may be high. However, some people with glaucoma may have normal eye pressure.</p>
<p>Glaucoma is usually caused by a build up of the fluid which flows through the eye. This build up occurs because the fluid drains out of your eye more slowly than it is being pumped in. Since new fluid continues to enter the eye, joining the fluid already there, the pressure continues to rise. This raised pressure may damage the back of the eye resulting in gradual loss of sight. Damage can progress so slowly that the person is not aware of this gradual loss of sight. Sometimes even normal eye pressure is associated with damage to the back of the eye.</p>
<p>There are usually no symptoms of glaucoma. The only way of knowing that you have glaucoma is to have your eye pressure, optic nerve and visual field checked by an eye specialist. If glaucoma is not treated, it can lead to serious problems, including total blindness. In fact, untreated glaucoma is one of the most common causes of blindness.</p>
<p>Simbrinza is not suitable for use in acute angle-closure glaucoma.</p>
<p>Simbrinza combines two ingredients, brinzolamide and brimonidine tartrate. Brinzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and brimonidine tartrate is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist. Both brinzolamide and brimonidine tartrate work by reducing the production of fluid within the eye.</p>
<p>For more information about glaucoma in Australia, contact Glaucoma Australia (telephone 1800 500 880). In New Zealand contact Glaucoma New Zealand on 09 373 8779 or free phone on 0800 GLAUCOMA or 0800 452 826.</p>
<p>Your doctor may have prescribed Simbrinza for another reason. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why Simbrinza has been prescribed for you.</p>
<p>This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that Simbrinza is addictive.</p>

</ul>
<p>These medicines may be affected by Simbrinza, or may affect how well it works. You may need different amounts of your medicines, or you may need to take different medicines.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist has more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while using Simbrinza.</p>
<h2>How to use SIMBRINZA</h2>
<p><strong>Carefully follow all directions given to you by your doctor and pharmacist.</strong> They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.</p>
<p>If you are being changed from one medicine to another, follow your doctor's instructions carefully as to when to stop the medicine and when to start the new eye drops.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not understand the instructions on the carton, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How much to use</em></h3>
<p>Use Simbrinza only when prescribed by your doctor.</p>
<p>The usual dose of Simbrinza is one drop in the affected eye(s) twice daily. Usually, this means one drop in the affected eye(s) first thing in the morning, and one drop in the evening.</p>
<p><strong>Your doctor will tell you how many drops you need to use each day.</strong> These dosing instructions will be printed on the label your pharmacist adds.</p>
<h3><em>How to use it</em></h3>
<p>It is important to use Simbrinza exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. If you use the drops less often than prescribed, they may not work as well and the eye problem may not improve. Using the drops more often than prescribed may not improve the eye problem any faster and may cause increased side effects.</p>
<p>If you are wearing soft contact lenses, remove them before putting the drops in your eye.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to use the eye drops:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.</li>
<li>Immediately before using a bottle for the first time, break the safety seal around the neck area and throw the loose plastic ring away.</li>
<li>Shake the bottle.</li>
<li>Remove the cap from the bottle.</li>
<li>Hold the bottle upside down in one hand between your thumb and middle finger (see Diagram 1).</li>
</ol>
<p><img src=""https://www.emims.com.au/resources/drugs/australia/cmi/C1159101.gif""/></p>
<ol>
<li>While tilting your head back, gently pull down the lower eyelid of your eye to form a pouch/pocket.</li>
<li>Place the tip of the bottle close to your eye. Do not let it touch your eye. Do not squeeze the bottle.</li>
<li>Release one drop into the pouch/pocket formed between your eye and eyelid by gently tapping or pressing the base of the bottle with your forefinger (see Diagrams 2 and 3).</li>
</ol>
<p><img src=""https://www.emims.com.au/resources/drugs/australia/cmi/C1159102.gif""/></p>
<p><img src=""https://www.emims.com.au/resources/drugs/australia/cmi/C1159103.gif""/></p>
<ol>
<li>Close your eye. Do not blink or rub your eye.</li>
<li>While your eye is closed, place your index finger against the inside corner of your eye and press against your nose for about two minutes. This will help to stop the medicine from draining through the tear duct to the nose and throat, from where it can be absorbed into other parts of your body. This will also reduce the unpleasant taste sensation that some people experience when using these drops.</li>
<li>If necessary, repeat the above steps for the other eye.</li>
<li>Your eyelids can only hold less than one drop at a time, so it is normal for a small amount of the eye drop to spill onto your cheek. You should wipe away any spillage with a tissue.</li>
<li>Replace the cap on the bottle, closing it tightly.</li>
<li>Wash your hands again with soap and water to remove any residue.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may feel a slight burning sensation in the eye shortly after using the eye drops. If this persists, or is very uncomfortable, contact your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p><strong>Be careful not to touch the dropper tip against your eye, eyelid or anything else.</strong> This will help prevent the drops becoming dirty or contaminated.</p>
<p>If you have trouble knowing whether you have placed your drops correctly, you may want to store them in the fridge. Some people find it easier to feel the drops in the eye if they are cold.</p>
<p>After using Simbrinza, wait at least 5 minutes before putting any other eye drops in your eye(s).</p>
<p>Wait 15 minutes before replacing your contact lenses.</p>
<h3><em>When to use it</em></h3>
<p>Use Simbrinza every day, at about the same times each day, unless your doctor tells you otherwise. Using your eye drops at the same times each day will have the best effect on your eye pressure. It will also help you remember when to use the eye drops.</p>
<h3><em>How long to use it</em></h3>
<p>Simbrinza helps control your condition but does not cure it. Simbrinza must be used every day. Continue using Simbrinza for as long as your doctor prescribes.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about when or how to stop using Simbrinza, you should talk to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<h3><em>If you forget to use it</em></h3>
<p><strong>If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and use your next dose when you are meant to.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Otherwise, use the drops as soon as you remember, and then go back to using them as you would normally.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not use double the amount to make up for the dose that you missed.</strong> Using multiple doses may cause unwanted side effects.</p>
<p><strong>If you are not sure whether to skip the dose, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have trouble remembering to use your eye drops, ask your pharmacist for some hints.</strong></p>
<h3><em>If you use too much (overdose)</em></h3>
<p>If you accidentally put several drops in your eye(s), immediately rinse your eye(s) with warm water.</p>
<p><strong>If you think that you or anyone else may have swallowed any or all of the contents of a bottle of Simbrinza, immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre on 13 1126 in Australia or the National Poisons Centre in New Zealand on 0800 POISON or 0800 764 for advice. Alternatively go to Accident and Emergency at your nearest hospital. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.</strong></p>
<h2>While you are using SIMBRINZA</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p>Have your eye pressure checked when your eye specialist says, to make sure Simbrinza is working.</p>
<p><strong>If you are about to start taking or using any new medicine, tell your doctor and pharmacist that you are using Simbrinza.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell all the doctors, dentists and pharmacists who are treating you that you are using Simbrinza.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if, for any reason, you have not used Simbrinza exactly as prescribed. Otherwise your doctor may think that the eye drops were not effective and change the treatment unnecessarily.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you become pregnant or decide to breast-feed while using Simbrinza, tell your doctor immediately.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not use Simbrinza to treat other complaints unless your doctor tells you to.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not give Simbrinza to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not stop using Simbrinza without first talking to your doctor. If you stop using your eye drops, your eye pressure may rise again and damage to your eye may occur.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not put the Simbrinza eye drops into your eye(s) while you are wearing soft contact lenses.</strong> The preservative in Simbrinza (benzalkonium chloride) may be deposited in soft contact lenses. You can put your soft contact lenses back into your eyes 15 minutes after you have used Simbrinza.</p>
<h3><em>Things to be careful of</em></h3>
<p><strong>Be careful driving, operating machinery or performing tasks requiring mental alertness and/or physical coordination until you know how Simbrinza affects you and your vision. As with any eye medicine, temporary blurred vision or other visual disturbances may affect the ability to drive or use machinery in some people. If blurred vision occurs when you use your drops, wait until your vision is clear before driving or operating machinery.</strong></p>
<h2>Side effects</h2>
<p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are using Simbrinza.</p>
<p>Simbrinza helps most people with high eye pressure and glaucoma, but it may have unwanted side effects in a few people.</p>
<p>All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical treatment if you get some of the side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Do not be alarmed by the following list of possible side effects. You may not experience any of them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you notice any of the following effects in the eye(s) and the eye area, and they worry you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>blurred vision</li>
<li>eye allergy</li>
<li>eye discomfort</li>
<li>eye pain</li>
<li>eye redness</li>
<li>eye surface inflammation</li>
<li>feeling of having something in the eye.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the more common side effects of your medicine. They are usually mild and short-lived.</p>
<p>Additional side effects that are noticed less often include:</p>
<ul>
<li>eye surface inflammation with surface damage</li>
<li>sensitivity to bright light</li>
<li>excessive tearing</li>

<li>redness of the eyelids</li>
<li>tired eyes</li>
<li>inflammation of the eyelids</li>
<li>deposits on the eye surface</li>

</ul>
<p>Occasionally some people notice unwanted effects in the rest of their body as a result of using Simbrinza. These effects may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>difficulty sleeping</li>
<li>drowsiness</li>
<li>bad taste in the mouth</li>
<li>headache</li>
<li>dizziness</li>
<li>decreased blood pressure</li>

<ul>
<li>skin rash</li>
<li>swelling of the face, hands or feet</li>
<li>wheezing, difficulty in breathing</li>
<li>shortness of breath (dyspnoea, heart failure)</li>
<li>severe and sudden onset of pinkish, itchy swellings on the skin, also called hives or nettle rash</li>
</ul>
<p>These hypersensitivity reactions can be very serious side effects. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation. These side effects are very rare.</p>
<p>Other side effects not listed above may also occur in some people.</p>
<h2>After using SIMBRINZA</h2>
<h3><em>Storage</em></h3>
<p>Store Simbrinza in a cool dry place where the temperature stays below 25°C. It is not necessary to store Simbrinza in the refrigerator, but it is acceptable if you prefer to instil cold drops.</p>
<p><strong>Do not store Simbrinza or any other medicine in the car, in the bathroom or in other warm, damp places.</strong> Heat and dampness can destroy some medicines.</p>
<p><strong>Do not leave the top off the bottle for any length of time, to avoid contaminating the eye drops.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keep it where children cannot reach it.</strong> A locked cupboard at least one-and-a-half metres above the ground is a good place to store medicines.</p>
<h3><em>Disposal</em></h3>
<p><strong>Write the date on the bottle when you open the eye drops and throw out any remaining solution after four weeks.</strong> Eye drops contain a preservative which helps prevent germs growing in the solution for the first four weeks after opening the bottle. After this time there is a greater risk that the drops may become contaminated and cause an eye infection. A new bottle should then be used.</p>
<p><strong>If your doctor tells you to stop using Simbrinza or they have passed their expiry date, ask your pharmacist what to do with any remaining solution.</strong></p>

What SIMBRINZA is used for
Simbrinza is used to lower pressure in the eye and to treat open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.
Glaucoma is a condition in which the pressure of fluid in the eye may be high. However, some people with glaucoma may have normal eye pressure.
Glaucoma is usually caused by a build up of the fluid which flows through the eye. This build up occurs because the fluid drains out of your eye more slowly than it is being pumped in. Since new fluid continues to enter the eye, joining the fluid already there, the pressure continues to rise. This raised pressure may damage the back of the eye resulting in gradual loss of sight. Damage can progress so slowly that the person is not aware of this gradual loss of sight. Sometimes even normal eye pressure is associated with damage to the back of the eye.
There are usually no symptoms of glaucoma. The only way of knowing that you have glaucoma is to have your eye pressure, optic nerve and visual field checked by an eye specialist. If glaucoma is not treated, it can lead to serious problems, including total blindness. In fact, untreated glaucoma is one of the most common causes of blindness.
Simbrinza is not suitable for use in acute angle-closure glaucoma.
Simbrinza combines two ingredients, brinzolamide and brimonidine tartrate. Brinzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and brimonidine tartrate is an alpha-2 adrenergic agonist. Both brinzolamide and brimonidine tartrate work by reducing the production of fluid within the eye.
For more information about glaucoma in Australia, contact Glaucoma Australia (telephone 1800 500 880). In New Zealand contact Glaucoma New Zealand on 09 373 8779 or free phone on 0800 GLAUCOMA or 0800 452 826.
Your doctor may have prescribed Simbrinza for another reason. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why Simbrinza has been prescribed for you.
This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription.
There is no evidence that Simbrinza is addictive.

How to use SIMBRINZA
Carefully follow all directions given to you by your doctor and pharmacist. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.
If you are being changed from one medicine to another, follow your doctor's instructions carefully as to when to stop the medicine and when to start the new eye drops.
If you do not understand the instructions on the carton, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.
How much to use
Use Simbrinza only when prescribed by your doctor.
The usual dose of Simbrinza is one drop in the affected eye(s) twice daily. Usually, this means one drop in the affected eye(s) first thing in the morning, and one drop in the evening.
Your doctor will tell you how many drops you need to use each day. These dosing instructions will be printed on the label your pharmacist adds.
How to use it
It is important to use Simbrinza exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. If you use the drops less often than prescribed, they may not work as well and the eye problem may not improve. Using the drops more often than prescribed may not improve the eye problem any faster and may cause increased side effects.
If you are wearing soft contact lenses, remove them before putting the drops in your eye.
Follow these steps to use the eye drops:

Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.
Immediately before using a bottle for the first time, break the safety seal around the neck area and throw the loose plastic ring away.
Shake the bottle.
Remove the cap from the bottle.
Hold the bottle upside down in one hand between your thumb and middle finger (see Diagram 1).



While tilting your head back, gently pull down the lower eyelid of your eye to form a pouch/pocket.
Place the tip of the bottle close to your eye. Do not let it touch your eye. Do not squeeze the bottle.
Release one drop into the pouch/pocket formed between your eye and eyelid by gently tapping or pressing the base of the bottle with your forefinger (see Diagrams 2 and 3).




Close your eye. Do not blink or rub your eye.
While your eye is closed, place your index finger against the inside corner of your eye and press against your nose for about two minutes. This will help to stop the medicine from draining through the tear duct to the nose and throat, from where it can be absorbed into other parts of your body. This will also reduce the unpleasant taste sensation that some people experience when using these drops.
If necessary, repeat the above steps for the other eye.
Your eyelids can only hold less than one drop at a time, so it is normal for a small amount of the eye drop to spill onto your cheek. You should wipe away any spillage with a tissue.
Replace the cap on the bottle, closing it tightly.
Wash your hands again with soap and water to remove any residue.

You may feel a slight burning sensation in the eye shortly after using the eye drops. If this persists, or is very uncomfortable, contact your doctor or pharmacist.
Be careful not to touch the dropper tip against your eye, eyelid or anything else. This will help prevent the drops becoming dirty or contaminated.
If you have trouble knowing whether you have placed your drops correctly, you may want to store them in the fridge. Some people find it easier to feel the drops in the eye if they are cold.

Otherwise, use the drops as soon as you remember, and then go back to using them as you would normally.
Do not use double the amount to make up for the dose that you missed. Using multiple doses may cause unwanted side effects.
If you are not sure whether to skip the dose, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
If you have trouble remembering to use your eye drops, ask your pharmacist for some hints.
If you use too much (overdose)
If you accidentally put several drops in your eye(s), immediately rinse your eye(s) with warm water.
If you think that you or anyone else may have swallowed any or all of the contents of a bottle of Simbrinza, immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre on 13 1126 in Australia or the National Poisons Centre in New Zealand on 0800 POISON or 0800 764 for advice. Alternatively go to Accident and Emergency at your nearest hospital. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.
While you are using SIMBRINZA
Things you must do
Have your eye pressure checked when your eye specialist says, to make sure Simbrinza is working.
If you are about to start taking or using any new medicine, tell your doctor and pharmacist that you are using Simbrinza.
Tell all the doctors, dentists and pharmacists who are treating you that you are using Simbrinza.
Tell your doctor if, for any reason, you have not used Simbrinza exactly as prescribed. Otherwise your doctor may think that the eye drops were not effective and change the treatment unnecessarily.
If you become pregnant or decide to breast-feed while using Simbrinza, tell your doctor immediately.
Things you must not do
Do not use Simbrinza to treat other complaints unless your doctor tells you to.
Do not give Simbrinza to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.
Do not stop using Simbrinza without first talking to your doctor. If you stop using your eye drops, your eye pressure may rise again and damage to your eye may occur.
Do not put the Simbrinza eye drops into your eye(s) while you are wearing soft contact lenses. The preservative in Simbrinza (benzalkonium chloride) may be deposited in soft contact lenses. You can put your soft contact lenses back into your eyes 15 minutes after you have used Simbrinza.
Things to be careful of
Be careful driving, operating machinery or performing tasks requiring mental alertness and/or physical coordination until you know how Simbrinza affects you and your vision. As with any eye medicine, temporary blurred vision or other visual disturbances may affect the ability to drive or use machinery in some people. If blurred vision occurs when you use your drops, wait until your vision is clear before driving or operating machinery.
Side effects
Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are using Simbrinza.
Simbrinza helps most people with high eye pressure and glaucoma, but it may have unwanted side effects in a few people.
All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical treatment if you get some of the side effects.
Do not be alarmed by the following list of possible side effects. You may not experience any of them.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.
Tell your doctor if you notice any of the following effects in the eye(s) and the eye area, and they worry you:

blurred vision
eye allergy
eye discomfort
eye pain
eye redness
eye surface inflammation
feeling of having something in the eye.

These are the more common side effects of your medicine. They are usually mild and short-lived.
Additional side effects that are noticed less often include:

eye surface inflammation with surface damage
sensitivity to bright light
excessive tearing
dry eye
eye discharge
redness of the eyelids
tired eyes
inflammation of the eyelids
deposits on the eye surface
eye and eyelid swelling.

Occasionally some people notice unwanted effects in the rest of their body as a result of using Simbrinza. These effects may include:

difficulty sleeping
drowsiness
bad taste in the mouth
headache
dizziness
decreased blood pressure
dry throat
stuffy nose
dry nose
postnasal drip
dry mouth
indigestion
abdominal pain
abnormal sensation in mouth
skin inflammation, redness or itching
medication residue.

If any of the following happen, stop using Simbrinza and tell your doctor immediately or go to Accident and Emergency at your nearest hospital:

skin rash
swelling of the face, hands or feet
wheezing, difficulty in breathing
shortness of breath (dyspnoea, heart failure)
severe and sudden onset of pinkish, itchy swellings on the skin, also called hives or nettle rash

These hypersensitivity reactions can be very serious side effects. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation. These side effects are very rare.
Other side effects not listed above may also occur in some people.
After using SIMBRINZA
Storage
Store Simbrinza in a cool dry place where the temperature stays below 25°C. It is not necessary to store Simbrinza in the refrigerator, but it is acceptable if you prefer to instil cold drops.
Do not store Simbrinza or any other medicine in the car, in the bathroom or in other warm, damp places. Heat and dampness can destroy some medicines.
Do not leave the top off the bottle for any length of time, to avoid contaminating the eye drops.
Keep it where children cannot reach it. A locked cupboard at least one-and-a-half metres above the ground is a good place to store medicines.
Disposal
Write the date on the bottle when you open the eye drops and throw out any remaining solution after four weeks. Eye drops contain a preservative which helps prevent germs growing in the solution for the first four weeks after opening the bottle. After this time there is a greater risk that the drops may become contaminated and cause an eye infection. A new bottle should then be used.
If your doctor tells you to stop using Simbrinza or they have passed their expiry date, ask your pharmacist what to do with any remaining solution.

<hr/>
<p><strong>Consumer Medicine Information</strong></p>
<h2>What is in this leaflet</h2>
<p>This leaflet answers some common questions about Progout.</p>
<p>It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>All medicines have benefits and risks. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking Progout against the benefits expected for you.or your child.</p>
<p><strong>If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keep this leaflet with your medicine.</strong> You may need to read it again.</p>
<h2>What Progout is used for</h2>
<p>Progout is used in the treatment of:</p>
<ul>
<li>gouty arthritis or gout, a condition of painful swollen joints caused by uric acid crystals</li>
<li>kidney stones</li>
<li>other rare conditions where high levels of uric acid occur in the blood, for example Lesch-Nyhan syndrome.</li>
</ul>
<p>Progout helps to treat the symptoms of these conditions but will not cure them. It will not help treat the pain that occurs in an acute attack of gout.</p>
<p>Progout belongs to a group of medicines called anti-uricaemic agents. These medicines reduce the amount of uric acid in the body. Most commonly, high levels of uric acid in the body are related to gout. Excess amounts of uric acid in the blood may lead to the development of crystals which deposit in the joints, causing pain, swelling and tenderness.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why Progout has been prescribed for you.</strong></p>
<p>Your doctor may have prescribed Progout for another reason.</p>
<p>Progout is available only with a doctor's prescription.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that Progout is addictive.</p>
<h2>Before you take Progout</h2>
<h3><em>When you must not take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not take Progout if you are allergic to medicines containing allopurinol (e.g. Zyloprim) or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet, including lactose.</strong> Some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction may include skin rash, itching or hives; swelling of the face, lips or tongue which may cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing; wheezing or shortness of breath.</p>
<p><strong>Do not take Progout if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>you or a member of your immediate family have haemochromatosis, a condition where there is too much iron in the body, and you are also taking iron salts at the same time.</li>
<li>you are having an acute attack of gout.<br>
If a person first starts taking Progout when they are having an attack of gout it can make the symptoms of this condition temporarily worse. However, if an acute attack of gout does occur when a person is already taking Progout, it can be continued. Do not stop taking this medicine during an attack of gout unless advised by your doctor.</br></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do not take Progout if the expiry date (EXP.) printed on the pack has passed.</strong> If you take this medicine after the expiry date, it may not work as well.</p>
<p><strong>Do not take Progout if the packaging shows signs of tampering or the tablets do not look like the tablets described at the end of this leaflet.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Before you start to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you are allergic to any other medicines, foods, dyes or preservatives.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.</strong> Your doctor will discuss the risks and benefits of taking Progout during pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you are breastfeeding or wish to breastfeed.</strong> Progout passes into breast milk and may affect your baby. Your doctor will discuss the risks and benefits of taking Progout when breastfeeding.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you have, or have had, any medical conditions, especially the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>liver problems</li>
<li>kidney problems</li>
<li>high blood pressure</li>
<li>heart failure or other heart problems</li>
<li>diabetes mellitus</li>
<li>epilepsy</li>
<li>haemochromatosis (a disease involving excessive deposits of iron in the body).</li>
</ul>
<p>Your doctor may want to take special care if you have any of these conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you plan to have surgery.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have not told your doctor about any of the above, tell them before you start taking Progout.</strong></p>
<h2>Taking other medicines</h2>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines, including any that you buy without a prescription from a pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.</strong></p>
<p>Some medicines may be affected by Progout, or may affect how well it works. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>aspirin and other salicylates</li>
<li>probenecid, a medicine used to treat gout</li>
<li>warfarin (Coumadin, Marevan), a medicine used to prevent blood clots</li>
<li>azathioprine (e.g. Imuran) and cyclosporin (Neoral, Sandimmun), medicines used to prevent organ transplant rejection or to treat certain the immune system problems</li>
<li>mercaptopurine (Puri-Nethol), a medicine used in the treatment of leukaemia</li>
<li>chlorpropamide, a medicine for diabetes</li>
<li>phenytoin (Dilantin), a medicine for epilepsy</li>
<li>theophylline (Nuelin), a medicine used in asthma</li>
<li>antibiotics called amoxycillin (e.g. Amoxil, Moxacin) and ampicillin (Alphacin)</li>
<li>thiazide diuretics or fluid tablets (e.g.Dithiazide).</li>
</ul>
<p>The above medicines may reduce the effectiveness of Progout, reduce its own effectiveness and/or react with Progout resulting in untoward or sometimes dangerous side effects.</p>
<p>The above list is not exhaustive.Your doctor can tell you what to do if you are taking any of these medicines.</p>
<p><strong>If you are not sure whether you are taking any of these medicines, check with your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p>Your doctor and pharmacist have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while taking Progout.</p>
<h2>How to take Progout</h2>
<p><strong>Follow all directions given to you by your doctor and pharmacist carefully.</strong> They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not understand the instructions on the bottle, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How much to take</em></h3>
<p>The dose varies from person to person. Your doctor will tell you how much to take.</p>
<p>The usual dose is 100 mg to 600 mg daily in divided doses (that is one 100mg tablet daily up to one 300mg tablet twice daily) but the dose may be as much as 900mg daily to treat very high blood levels of uric acid.</p>
<p>Elderly people over 65 years of age usually receive the lowest dose possible to control uric acid production.</p>
<p>Children under 15 years of age usually take 100 mg to 400 mg daily in divided doses.</p>
<p>Your doctor may advise you to take a different dose. This depends on your condition and whether or not you are taking any other medicines.</p>
<h3><em>How to take Progout</em></h3>
<p><strong>Swallow the tablets with plenty of water to reduce the possibility of gastric upset.</strong></p>
<h3><em>When to take Progout</em></h3>
<p><strong>Take Progout during or immediately after food at the frequency directed by your doctor.</strong></p>
<p>Progout is usually taken once a day. However, if your dose is higher than 300 mg a day, your doctor may advise you to take it morning and night.</p>
<h3><em>If you forget to take Progout</em></h3>
<p><strong>If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Otherwise, take the missed dose as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking your tablets as you would normally.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose you missed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How long to take Progout for</em></h3>
<p><strong>To properly control your condition, Progout must be taken every day.</strong></p>
<p>Progout will not cure your condition but will help control pain, stiffness and other symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Keep taking Progout for as long as your doctor recommends.</strong></p>
<h3><em>If you take too much Progout (overdose)</em></h3>
<p><strong>Immediately telephone your doctor, or the Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26), or go to Accident and Emergency at the nearest hospital, if you think you or anyone else may have taken too much Progout. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You may need urgent medical attention.</strong></p>
<p>If you take too much Progout, you may feel dizzy, nauseous, and experience vomiting and diarrhoea.</p>
<h2>While you are taking Progout</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Drink at least 2 litres (8 to 10 glasses) of fluid each day.</strong> This will help to reduce the levels of uric acid in your body and prevent the formation of kidney stones.</p>
<p><strong>Stop taking Progout immediately if you develop a skin rash or any other sign of an allergic reaction.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Before starting any new medicine, tell your doctor or pharmacist that you are taking Progout.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell all the doctors, dentists and pharmacists who are treating you that you are taking Progout.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you become pregnant while taking Progout, tell your doctor immediately.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Visit your doctor regularly so they can check on your progress.</strong> You may need to have blood or urine tests.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you feel Progout is not helping your condition.</strong> If you continue to have painful attacks of gout your doctor may need to adjust your treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if, for any reason, you have not taken Progout exactly as prescribed.</strong></p>
<p>Otherwise, your doctor may adjust your treatment unnecessarily.</p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not take Progout to treat an acute attack of gout.</strong> Your doctor will prescribe another medicine such as colchicine or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to relieve an acute attack of gout.</p>
<p><strong>Do not use Progout to treat any other conditions unless your doctor tells you to.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not give Progout to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things to be careful of</em></h3>
<p><strong>Be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how Progout affects you.</strong> Progout may cause drowsiness, dizziness or lack of co-ordination in some people. If any of these occur, do not drive, operate machinery or do anything else that could be dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid drinking alcohol while taking Progout.</strong> Combining Progout and alcohol can make you more sleepy, dizzy or lightheaded. Alcohol may also increase the formation of uric acid.</p>
<p><strong>Certain foods are best avoided when you have gout.</strong> Food such as organ meats, anchovies and yeast extracts (includes Vegemite®) can increase the levels of uric acid in your body. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more advice about which foods to avoid.</p>
<h2>Side effects</h2>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking Progout.</strong></p>
<p>Progout helps most people with gouty arthritis and kidney stones, but it may have unwanted side effects in some people.</p>
<p>Side effects only occur rarely in people taking Progout. Most of the time they are minor. You may need medical treatment if you get some of the side effects.</p>
<p>People with liver and kidney problems have an increased chance of experiencing side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Do not be alarmed by this list of possible side effects.</strong> You may not experience any of them.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The most common side effect is skin rash. Stop treatment with PROGOUT immediately and contact your doctor if a rash does occur.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you notice any of the following and they worry you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>nausea, vomiting</li>
<li>headache</li>
<li>oedema (swelling)</li>
<li>drowsiness, dizziness, unsteadiness when walking</li>
<li>high blood pressure</li>
<li>abdominal pain</li>
<li>skin rash</li>
<li>blurred vision, vision problems</li>
<li>confusion</li>
<li>unexplained nosebleeds</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If any of the following happen, stop taking Progout and tell your doctor immediately, or go to Accident and Emergency at the nearest hospital:</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>These are very serious yet rare side effects. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you notice anything that is making you feel unwell.</strong></p>
<p>Other side effects not listed above may also occur in some patients. Some of these side effects (e.g. high blood pressure) can only be found when your doctor does tests from time to time to check your progress.</p>
<p><strong>Check with your doctor as soon as possible if you have any problems while taking Progout, even if you do not think the problems are connected with the medicine or are not listed in this leaflet.</strong></p>
<h2>After taking Progout</h2>

The above medicines may reduce the effectiveness of Progout, reduce its own effectiveness and/or react with Progout resulting in untoward or sometimes dangerous side effects.
The above list is not exhaustive.Your doctor can tell you what to do if you are taking any of these medicines.
If you are not sure whether you are taking any of these medicines, check with your doctor or pharmacist.
Your doctor and pharmacist have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while taking Progout.
How to take Progout
Follow all directions given to you by your doctor and pharmacist carefully. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.
If you do not understand the instructions on the bottle, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
How much to take
The dose varies from person to person. Your doctor will tell you how much to take.
The usual dose is 100 mg to 600 mg daily in divided doses (that is one 100mg tablet daily up to one 300mg tablet twice daily) but the dose may be as much as 900mg daily to treat very high blood levels of uric acid.
Elderly people over 65 years of age usually receive the lowest dose possible to control uric acid production.
Children under 15 years of age usually take 100 mg to 400 mg daily in divided doses.
Your doctor may advise you to take a different dose. This depends on your condition and whether or not you are taking any other medicines.
How to take Progout
Swallow the tablets with plenty of water to reduce the possibility of gastric upset.
When to take Progout
Take Progout during or immediately after food at the frequency directed by your doctor.
Progout is usually taken once a day. However, if your dose is higher than 300 mg a day, your doctor may advise you to take it morning and night.
If you forget to take Progout
If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to.
Otherwise, take the missed dose as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking your tablets as you would normally.
Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose you missed.
If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
If you have any questions about this, check with your doctor or pharmacist.
How long to take Progout for
To properly control your condition, Progout must be taken every day.
Progout will not cure your condition but will help control pain, stiffness and other symptoms.
Keep taking Progout for as long as your doctor recommends.
If you take too much Progout (overdose)
Immediately telephone your doctor, or the Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26), or go to Accident and Emergency at the nearest hospital, if you think you or anyone else may have taken too much Progout. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.
You may need urgent medical attention.
If you take too much Progout, you may feel dizzy, nauseous, and experience vomiting and diarrhoea.
While you are taking Progout
Things you must do
Drink at least 2 litres (8 to 10 glasses) of fluid each day. This will help to reduce the levels of uric acid in your body and prevent the formation of kidney stones.
Stop taking Progout immediately if you develop a skin rash or any other sign of an allergic reaction.
Before starting any new medicine, tell your doctor or pharmacist that you are taking Progout.
Tell all the doctors, dentists and pharmacists who are treating you that you are taking Progout.
If you become pregnant while taking Progout, tell your doctor immediately.
Visit your doctor regularly so they can check on your progress. You may need to have blood or urine tests.
Tell your doctor if you feel Progout is not helping your condition. If you continue to have painful attacks of gout your doctor may need to adjust your treatment.
Tell your doctor if, for any reason, you have not taken Progout exactly as prescribed.
Otherwise, your doctor may adjust your treatment unnecessarily.
Things you must not do
Do not take Progout to treat an acute attack of gout. Your doctor will prescribe another medicine such as colchicine or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to relieve an acute attack of gout.
Do not use Progout to treat any other conditions unless your doctor tells you to.
Do not give Progout to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.
Things to be careful of
Be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how Progout affects you. Progout may cause drowsiness, dizziness or lack of co-ordination in some people. If any of these occur, do not drive, operate machinery or do anything else that could be dangerous.
Avoid drinking alcohol while taking Progout. Combining Progout and alcohol can make you more sleepy, dizzy or lightheaded. Alcohol may also increase the formation of uric acid.
Certain foods are best avoided when you have gout. Food such as organ meats, anchovies and yeast extracts (includes Vegemite®) can increase the levels of uric acid in your body. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more advice about which foods to avoid.
Side effects
Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking Progout.
Progout helps most people with gouty arthritis and kidney stones, but it may have unwanted side effects in some people.
Side effects only occur rarely in people taking Progout. Most of the time they are minor. You may need medical treatment if you get some of the side effects.
People with liver and kidney problems have an increased chance of experiencing side effects.
Do not be alarmed by this list of possible side effects. You may not experience any of them.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.
The most common side effect is skin rash. Stop treatment with PROGOUT immediately and contact your doctor if a rash does occur.
Tell your doctor if you notice any of the following and they worry you:

nausea, vomiting
headache
oedema (swelling)
drowsiness, dizziness, unsteadiness when walking
high blood pressure
abdominal pain
skin rash
blurred vision, vision problems
confusion
unexplained nosebleeds

If any of the following happen, stop taking Progout and tell your doctor immediately, or go to Accident and Emergency at the nearest hospital:

fatty stools
going to the toilet often
blood in the urine
hair loss
general malaise or depression
sleepiness
confusion or vision problems
numbness in the limbs
angina (chest pain involving the heart)
severe palpitations
severe itching, skin flaking, skin rash or hives
swelling of the face, lips or tongue which may cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing
wheezing or shortness of breath
pain or tightness in the chest
if chills, fever, joint pain or swollen glands occur, especially if they occur together with or shortly after a skin rash.

These are very serious yet rare side effects. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation.
Tell your doctor if you notice anything that is making you feel unwell.
Other side effects not listed above may also occur in some patients. Some of these side effects (e.g. high blood pressure) can only be found when your doctor does tests from time to time to check your progress.
Check with your doctor as soon as possible if you have any problems while taking Progout, even if you do not think the problems are connected with the medicine or are not listed in this leaflet.
After taking Progout
Storage
Keep Progout where children cannot reach it. A locked cupboard at least one-and-a-half metres above the ground is a good place to store medicines.
Keep your tablets in the bottle until it is time to take them. If you take the tablets out of the bottle they may not keep well.
Keep your tablets in a cool dry place where the temperature stays below 30°C.
Do not store Progout or any other medicine in the bathroom or near a sink.
Do not leave Progout in the car or on window sills. Heat and dampness can destroy some medicines.
Disposal
If your doctor tells you to stop taking Progout, or your tablets have passed their expiry date, ask your pharmacist what to do with any that are left over.

<h2>What this medicine is used for</h2>
<p>The name of your medicine is APO-Bisoprolol.</p>
<p>It contains the active ingredient bisoprolol fumarate.</p>
<p>It is used to treat heart failure. It is usually used in combination with other medicines.</p>
<p>Heart failure occurs when the heart muscle is weak and unable to pump enough blood to supply the body's needs. Heart failure may start off with no symptoms, but as the condition progresses patients may feel short of breath and notice swelling of the feet and ankles due to fluid build up.</p>
<p>Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you. Your doctor may have prescribed this medicine for another reason.</p>
<p>This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that this medicine is addictive.</p>
<h3><em>How it works</em></h3>
<p>Bisoprolol belongs to a group of medicines called beta-blockers.</p>
<p>These medicines work by affecting the body's response to some nerve impulses, especially in the heart. As a result, it decreases the heart's need for blood and oxygen and therefore reduces the amount of work the heart has to do.</p>
<p>Bisoprolol also slows your heart rate, which in turn increases the efficiency of your heart.</p>
<p>Bisoprolol can help to reduce the number of heart failure episodes needing hospital admission and also the risk of sudden death.</p>
<h3><em>Use in children</em></h3>
<p>Bisoprolol is not recommended for use in children, as the safety and efficacy in children have not been established.</p>
<h2>Before you take this medicine</h2>
<h3><em>When you must not take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not take this medicine if you are hypersensitive to or have had an allergic reaction to bisoprolol or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet.</strong></p>
<p>Some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction may include cough, shortness of breath, wheezing or difficulty breathing; swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat or other parts of the body; rash, itching or hives on the skin; fainting or hayfever-like symptoms.</p>
<p>If you think you are having an allergic reaction do not take any more of the medicine and contact your doctor immediately or go to the Accident and Emergency department at the nearest hospital.</p>
<p><strong>Do not take bisoprolol if you have any of the following heart problems:</strong></p>

What this medicine is used for
The name of your medicine is APO-Bisoprolol.
It contains the active ingredient bisoprolol fumarate.
It is used to treat heart failure. It is usually used in combination with other medicines.
Heart failure occurs when the heart muscle is weak and unable to pump enough blood to supply the body's needs. Heart failure may start off with no symptoms, but as the condition progresses patients may feel short of breath and notice swelling of the feet and ankles due to fluid build up.
Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you. Your doctor may have prescribed this medicine for another reason.
This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription.
There is no evidence that this medicine is addictive.
How it works
Bisoprolol belongs to a group of medicines called beta-blockers.
These medicines work by affecting the body's response to some nerve impulses, especially in the heart. As a result, it decreases the heart's need for blood and oxygen and therefore reduces the amount of work the heart has to do.
Bisoprolol also slows your heart rate, which in turn increases the efficiency of your heart.
Bisoprolol can help to reduce the number of heart failure episodes needing hospital admission and also the risk of sudden death.
Use in children
Bisoprolol is not recommended for use in children, as the safety and efficacy in children have not been established.

<h2>What Creon Micro is used for</h2>
<p>Creon Micro is a pancreatic enzyme supplement used in a condition called pancreatic exocrine insufficiency where the body does not make enough enzymes to digest food. This condition appears in a number of different patients including those with cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis, or patients who have had upper gastrointestinal surgery. People with a deficiency of pancreatic enzymes often suffer with symptoms of diarrhoea, steatorrhoea (foul fatty stools which float in the toilet), bloating and weight loss. These symptoms appear because the body is unable to digest food normally. When this happens your body's ability to absorb important nutrients from food is impaired and leads to malnutrition. If left untreated, these symptoms can affect your quality of life and a poor nutritional status could have long term health implications. The supplementation of pancreatic enzymes using Creon helps restore the normal digestive action in your body to relieve abdominal symptoms and improve nutritional status.</p>
<p>The enzymes are extracted from pancreas of pigs.</p>
<p>Creon Micro is approved for the uses listed above. However, your doctor may prescribe this medicine for another use. If you would like more information, ask your doctor.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that Creon Micro is addictive.</p>
<h2>Before you take Creon Micro</h2>
<h3><em>When you must not take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not take Creon Micro if you are allergic to pork, other pig products or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not take Creon Micro after the expiry date (EXP) printed on the pack.</strong> If you take this medicine after the expiry date has passed, it may not work as well.</p>
<p><strong>Do not take Creon Micro if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Before you start to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>You must tell your doctor if you are allergic to any other medicines or any foods, dyes or preservatives.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You must tell your doctor if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, are breast feeding or intend to breast feed.</strong> Your doctor will discuss whether you should take this product.</p>
<p><strong>If you have not told your doctor about any of the above, tell them before you take Creon Micro.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Taking other medicines</em></h3>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines, including any that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.</strong></p>
<p>You should avoid taking antacids, which are medicines that are used to treat heartburn and indigestion, at the same time as when taking Creon Micro. Antacids may affect how well Creon Micro work by breaking down the special coating used to protect the pancreatic enzymes. If it is necessary to take an antacid, then it should be taken at least one hour before you take your Creon Micro.</p>
<h2>How to take Creon Micro</h2>
<p><strong>Follow all directions given to you by your doctor carefully.</strong> These directions may differ from the information in this leaflet.</p>
<h3><em>How much to take</em></h3>
<p>Your doctor will tell you how much Creon Micro to take or give to your child. Do not increase the number of doses yourself without informing your doctor.</p>
<p>Your doctor has prescribed a dose of Creon for you or your child which is specifically tailored to the severity of the condition.</p>
<p>It is normally not necessary to restrict your diet of fat while you are taking Creon as your symptoms will usually be under control. In people with malnutrition, getting enough fat in the diet will help improve nutrition. If unsure, you should consult your doctor or dietitian regarding your diet whilst on Creon.</p>
<p>The maximum recommended dose of lipase in infants and children with cystic fibrosis is 10,000 units per kilogram body weight in 24 hours.</p>
<p>Patients who use more than 10,000 units per kilogram per day, will probably be monitored closely by their doctor.</p>
<h3><em>When to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Take Creon Micro with every meal and snack.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How to take it</em></h3>
<p>The small measuring scoop that is provided with the bottle is designed to contain a dose of 100 mg of granules. This amount provides 5,000 units of lipase.</p>
<p>Creon Micro can be added to small amounts of acidic soft food that do not require chewing such as apple juice or mashed bananas. The mixture of Creon Micro and soft food should be swallowed immediately without crushing or chewing, and followed with water or juice to ensure complete ingestion. Care should be taken to ensure that no drug is retained in the mouth.</p>
<p>In young infants, Creon Micro should be mixed with a small amount of apple juice and given from a spoon directly before the feed. In young infants, granules should be taken with acidic liquids or soft foods (e.g. mixed with apple juice or apple puree), but without chewing, directly before the meal. When giving Creon Micro to young infants the apple juice should not be diluted.</p>
<p>When you are taking Creon Micro, it is important to make sure that you drink plenty of liquid every day.</p>
<h3><em>If you forget to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Wait until your next meal or snack and take your usual number of doses.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have trouble remembering when to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for hints.</strong></p>
<h3><em>If you take too much (overdose)</em></h3>
<p><strong>If you, or anybody else, have taken too many Creon Micro drink plenty of water and contact your doctor, pharmacist or the Poisons Information Centre (13 11 26), or go to the casualty department of the hospital nearest to you. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.</strong></p>
<h2>While you are taking Creon Micro</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Make sure you tell your doctor if you are still having problems with fatty stools or abdominal pain while you are taking Creon Micro.</strong></p>
<p>Drink plenty of water every day when you are taking Creon Micro.</p>
<p><strong>Follow your doctor's instructions carefully and do not stop taking Creon Micro unless told to do so by your doctor.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are about to start taking any new medicines, tell your doctor and pharmacist that you are taking Creon Micro.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not give Creon Micro to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not use this medicine for any purpose other than for the purpose it has been recommended for you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not use more than the recommended amount.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not stop taking your medicine until your doctor tells you to do so.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not let yourself run out of medicine unless told to do so by your doctor.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Creon Micro has no influence on the ability to drive and use machinery.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things that may help your condition</em></h3>
<p>Diet should be considered as part of your overall management plan. Talk to your doctor for more information and advice.</p>
<h2>Side effects</h2>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking Creon Micro.</strong></p>
<p>Creon Micro helps most people whose bodies do not make enough enzymes to digest their food, but it may have unwanted side effects in a few people. All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical treatment if you get some of the side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you notice any of the following and they worry you:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- stomach or bowel problems, including:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>diarrhoea</strong></li>
<li><strong>constipation</strong></li>
<li><strong>abnormal stools</strong></li>
<li><strong>abdominal discomfort</strong></li>
<li><strong>nausea</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>- skin reactions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor immediately if you have severe or prolonged abdominal pain.</strong> If you take too much Creon Micro you may get irritation or inflammation in the anal region.</p>
<p><strong>Do not be alarmed by this list of possible side effects.</strong> You may not experience any of them.</p>
<p>The active ingredient in Creon Micro is an extract of pancreatic powder of porcine origin (pigs), therefore the presence of porcine parvovirus or other porcine viruses cannot be totally excluded. However, there is no evidence of transmission of these viruses to humans or of porcine pancreatic powder extracts causing illness in humans.</p>
<h2>After taking Creon Micro</h2>
<h3><em>Storage</em></h3>
<p>Keep the container tightly closed in order to protect from moisture.</p>
<p><strong>Keep your Creon Micro in a cool dry place where the temperature stays below 25°C. Please note that in warmer climates it may be necessary to store Creon Micro in the refrigerator. After opening use within 3 months.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not store it, or any other medicine, in the bathroom or near a sink.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not leave it in the car or on a window sill on hot days.</strong> Heat and dampness can destroy some medicines.</p>
<p><strong>Keep it where young children cannot reach it.</strong> A locked cupboard at least one-and-half metres above the ground is a good place to store medicines.</p>
<h3><em>Disposal</em></h3>
<p>If your doctor tells you to stop taking Creon Micro or they passed their expiry date, ask your pharmacist what to do with any that are left over.</p>

<p>Creon Micro helps most people whose bodies do not make enough enzymes to digest their food, but it may have unwanted side effects in a few people. All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical treatment if you get some of the side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you notice any of the following and they worry you:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- stomach or bowel problems, including:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>diarrhoea</strong></li>
<li><strong>constipation</strong></li>

<p><strong>Do not be alarmed by this list of possible side effects.</strong> You may not experience any of them.</p>
<p>The active ingredient in Creon Micro is an extract of pancreatic powder of porcine origin (pigs), therefore the presence of porcine parvovirus or other porcine viruses cannot be totally excluded.

Consumer Medicine Information
What is in this leaflet
This leaflet answers some of the common questions about Creon Micro. It does not contain all of the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.
Please read this leaflet before you start taking Creon Micro.
If you are helping someone else to take Creon Micro, please read this leaflet before you give the first dose.
All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking Creon Micro against the benefits expected for you.
If you have any concerns about taking Creon Micro, ask your doctor or pharmacist. Your doctor and pharmacist have more information.
Keep this leaflet with your Creon Micro. You may need to read it again.
What Creon Micro is used for
Creon Micro is a pancreatic enzyme supplement used in a condition called pancreatic exocrine insufficiency where the body does not make enough enzymes to digest food. This condition appears in a number of different patients including those with cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis, or patients who have had upper gastrointestinal surgery. People with a deficiency of pancreatic enzymes often suffer with symptoms of diarrhoea, steatorrhoea (foul fatty stools which float in the toilet), bloating and weight loss. These symptoms appear because the body is unable to digest food normally. When this happens your body's ability to absorb important nutrients from food is impaired and leads to malnutrition. If left untreated, these symptoms can affect your quality of life and a poor nutritional status could have long term health implications. The supplementation of pancreatic enzymes using Creon helps restore the normal digestive action in your body to relieve abdominal symptoms and improve nutritional status.
The enzymes are extracted from pancreas of pigs.
Creon Micro is approved for the uses listed above. However, your doctor may prescribe this medicine for another use. If you would like more information, ask your doctor.
There is no evidence that Creon Micro is addictive.
Before you take Creon Micro
When you must not take it
Do not take Creon Micro if you are allergic to pork, other pig products or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet.
Do not take Creon Micro after the expiry date (EXP) printed on the pack. If you take this medicine after the expiry date has passed, it may not work as well.
Do not take Creon Micro if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering.
Before you start to take it
You must tell your doctor if you are allergic to any other medicines or any foods, dyes or preservatives.
You must tell your doctor if you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, are breast feeding or intend to breast feed. Your doctor will discuss whether you should take this product.
If you have not told your doctor about any of the above, tell them before you take Creon Micro.
Taking other medicines
Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines, including any that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.
You should avoid taking antacids, which are medicines that are used to treat heartburn and indigestion, at the same time as when taking Creon Micro. Antacids may affect how well Creon Micro work by breaking down the special coating used to protect the pancreatic enzymes. If it is necessary to take an antacid, then it should be taken at least one hour before you take your Creon Micro.
How to take Creon Micro
Follow all directions given to you by your doctor carefully. These directions may differ from the information in this leaflet.
How much to take
Your doctor will tell you how much Creon Micro to take or give to your child. Do not increase the number of doses yourself without informing your doctor.
Your doctor has prescribed a dose of Creon for you or your child which is specifically tailored to the severity of the condition.
It is normally not necessary to restrict your diet of fat while you are taking Creon as your symptoms will usually be under control. In people with malnutrition, getting enough fat in the diet will help improve nutrition. If unsure, you should consult your doctor or dietitian regarding your diet whilst on Creon.
The maximum recommended dose of lipase in infants and children with cystic fibrosis is 10,000 units per kilogram body weight in 24 hours.
Patients who use more than 10,000 units per kilogram per day, will probably be monitored closely by their doctor.
When to take it
Take Creon Micro with every meal and snack.
How to take it
The small measuring scoop that is provided with the bottle is designed to contain a dose of 100 mg of granules. This amount provides 5,000 units of lipase.
Creon Micro can be added to small amounts of acidic soft food that do not require chewing such as apple juice or mashed bananas. The mixture of Creon Micro and soft food should be swallowed immediately without crushing or chewing, and followed with water or juice to ensure complete ingestion. Care should be taken to ensure that no drug is retained in the mouth.
In young infants, Creon Micro should be mixed with a small amount of apple juice and given from a spoon directly before the feed. In young infants, granules should be taken with acidic liquids or soft foods (e.g. mixed with apple juice or apple puree), but without chewing, directly before the meal. When giving Creon Micro to young infants the apple juice should not be diluted.
When you are taking Creon Micro, it is important to make sure that you drink plenty of liquid every day.
If you forget to take it
Wait until your next meal or snack and take your usual number of doses.
Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed.
If you have trouble remembering when to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for hints.
If you take too much (overdose)
If you, or anybody else, have taken too many Creon Micro drink plenty of water and contact your doctor, pharmacist or the Poisons Information Centre (13 11 26), or go to the casualty department of the hospital nearest to you. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.

<p>Your doctor and pharmacist have more information on medicines you should be careful with or avoid whilst using Enstilar®.</p>
<h2>How to use Enstilar®</h2>
<p><strong>Caution: Extremely flammable. Please read important information under ‘Storage’.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Follow carefully all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist.</strong> They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.</p>
<p>If you do not understand the instructions in this leaflet, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.</p>
<p>Enstilar® is for topical use (on the skin). Before use, read the patient information, even if you have used Enstilar® before. Enstilar® is designed for direct application (spray on) to your skin, where it is affected by psoriasis.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Do not use more than 15g in one day. 15g corresponds to the amount sprayed from the can when the actuator is fully pressed down for 1 minute. Do not use more than 100g in one week.</p>
<p>For example, no more than 2 cans in one week. One 60g can should last you at least 4 days.</p>
<p>If you also use other calcipotriol containing products (e.g.: Daivobet® gel or ointment, Daivonex®) for your psoriasis, then the <strong>total</strong> amount of calcipotriol products must not exceed 15g per day or 100 grams per week.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you use more than the recommended amount of Enstilar®, the levels of calcium in your blood may rise. This is known as <strong>“hypercalcaemia”</strong>.</p>
<p>Hypercalcaemia:</p>
<ul>
<li>is measured by a blood test</li>
<li>may be harmful</li>
<li>may mean that Enstilar® or any other product containing calcipotriol (e.g.: Daivobet® gel or ointment, Daivonex®) should <strong>not</strong> be used until the calcium level has become normal again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Blood calcium levels will quickly normalise when your doctor discontinues Enstilar® treatment.</p>
<h3><em>How to use Enstilar®</em></h3>
<p>Enstilar® should be applied to <strong>dry</strong> skin on the affected areas of the body.</p>
<ol>
<li>Shake the can before use and remove the cap.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src=""https://www.emims.com.au/resources/drugs/australia/cmi/CENSTIL01.gif""/></p>
<ol>
<li>Apply the medication by holding the can at least 3cm (approximately 1.5 inches) from the skin and spray onto the affected area.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src=""https://www.emims.com.au/resources/drugs/australia/cmi/CENSTIL02.gif""/></p>
<ol>
<li>The foam can be sprayed by holding the can in any orientation except horizontally. Apply a layer of foam only to the psoriasis plaques. Spray directly onto each affected skin area and gently rub in. If you accidentally put some of the foam on normal skin, wipe it off as soon as possible.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src=""https://www.emims.com.au/resources/drugs/australia/cmi/CENSTIL03.gif""/></p>
<ol>
<li>Gently rub the foam into your affected skin areas<br/>
You will need to repeat steps 1 to 4 until all of the affected areas are covered.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src=""https://www.emims.com.au/resources/drugs/australia/cmi/CENSTIL04.gif""/></p>
<ol>
<li>After applying your medication, put the cap back on the can to prevent accidental pressing of the can when not in use.</li>
<li>Wash your hands well after using Enstilar® (unless you are using the foam to treat your hands). This will avoid accidentally spreading the foam to other parts of your body (especially face, mouth and eyes).</li>
<li>Take care not to get the foam spray in your eyes. If this happens, rinse your eyes with clean water and seek medical advice.</li>
<li>If you accidentally put some of the foam onto skin not affected by psoriasis, wipe it off as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Do not bandage, tightly cover or wrap the treated area</li>
</ol>
<p>For best results leave on during the day or night. The treated area does not need to be covered. You may wear your usual clothes however avoid contact with fabric that is easily stained by grease (e.g. silk).</p>
<p><strong>Do not use Enstilar®</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>on large areas of damaged skin;</li>
<li>in skin folds (eg. groin, underarm);</li>
<li>on the genitalia;</li>
<li>inside the mouth, nose or in the eyes;</li>
<li>on the face (an itchy red rash may develop).</li>
<li>under occlusive dressings (such as a bandage).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Wash your hands thoroughly after applying Enstilar® on any part of your body,</strong> unless your hands are being treated.</p>
<p>Thoroughly wash your hands prior to handling infants or children.</p>
<p>If any skin irritation develops, <strong>wash off the Enstilar®.</strong></p>
<h3><em>When to use Enstilar®</em></h3>
<p>Apply Enstilar® <strong>once a day</strong> at the most convenient time for you, trying to applying it about the same time of the day each day (for example, morning, afternoon or evening).</p>
<p>As a guide on how much Enstilar® to use: A short 2 second spray of Enstilar® provides 0.5g of the medication and this amount should be sufficient to cover an area of skin roughly corresponding to the area of an adult hand.</p>
<h3><em>How long to use it</em></h3>
<p>Each treatment course would normally last for up to four weeks.</p>
<p>Your doctor may decide to stop treatment with Enstilar® once your psoriasis has improved, and to recommence it as needed. Your doctor may decide on a different treatment period and/or repeated treatment.</p>
<h3><em>If you forget to use it</em></h3>
<p>If you forget to use Enstilar®, use it as soon as you remember, then continue as before. <strong>Do not</strong> use an increased dose of the foam to make up for the forgotten doses.</p>
<p><strong>If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have trouble remembering to use your medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist for some hints.</strong></p>
<h3><em>If you use too much or use it other than directed (Overdose)</em></h3>
<p><strong>Immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26 in Australia) for advice, or go to the Emergency Department at the nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have used too much or swallowed some of this medicine. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.</strong> You may need urgent medical attention.</p>
<h2>While you are using Enstilar®</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p>While you are using Enstilar®, protect the treated skin areas from sunlight and Ultraviolet (UV) rays, for example, by wearing protective clothing. This is particularly important if your job or lifestyle means you spend time outdoors</p>
<p><strong>If you are going to start any new medicine, tell your doctor and pharmacist that you are using Enstilar®.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you become pregnant while using Enstilar®, tell your doctor immediately.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keep all appointments with your doctor so that your progress can be checked.</strong> Your doctor may do blood tests whilst you are using Enstilar® (or any other product containing calcipotriol, for example Daivobet® gel or ointment, Daivonex®). These tests check the levels of calcium in your blood and how well your kidneys are working (“renal function”).</p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not give your medicine to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not use more than the recommended daily or weekly dose (see How to use Enstilar®).</strong></p>
<p>Do not use other topical corticosteroids (e.g. Advantan®, Diprosone®, Elocon®) on areas treated with Enstilar®.</p>
<h2>Side effects</h2>
<p>As with all medicines, Enstilar® can cause some side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Do not be alarmed by the following list of side effects. You may not experience any of them.</strong></p>
<p>Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>if you have any unpleasant effects while you are using Enstilar®<br/>
or</strong></li>
<li><strong>if you notice any of the following and they worry you:</strong> <br/>
- skin irritation (including itching, redness, burning, dryness, pain, swelling or peeling)<br/>
- a rash on your face or body<br/>
- a change in the colour of your skin<br/>
- your skin is more sensitive to light<br/>
- change in control of diabetes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Enstilar® contains butylated hydroxytoluene (E321).</strong> This may cause local skin reactions (e.g. contact dermatitis), or irritation to the eyes and mucous membranes.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice anything that is making you feel unwell.</strong> Other side effects not listed above may also occur in some people.</p>
<h2>After using Enstilar®</h2>
<p>Keep Enstilar® in the box until required.</p>
<h3><em>Storage</em></h3>
<p>Keep Enstilar® in a cool dry place, store below 25°C.</p>

Consumer Medicine Information
Please read this leaflet carefully before you start your treatment.
Enstilar® is the brand name. Enstilar® is a combination product. The generic names of the two active ingredients are calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate.
Keep this leaflet. You may want to read it again.
What is in this leaflet?
This leaflet answers some common questions about using the medicine Enstilar®. It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.
All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you using Enstilar® against the benefits it is expected to have for you.
If you have any concerns about using Enstilar®, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
What Enstilar® is used for
Enstilar® is a topical treatment for psoriasis. Psoriasis is a skin disorder in which skin cells are overactive. This causes redness, scaling and thickness of your skin. Enstilar® contains two active ingredients:

calcipotriol (related to Vitamin D);
betamethasone dipropionate (a corticosteroid).

The calcipotriol in Enstilar® treats the overactive skin cells. The betamethasone dipropionate relieves redness, swelling, itching and irritation of the skin.
Enstilar® is available only with a doctor’s prescription.
This medicine is not expected to affect your ability to drive a car or operate machinery.
This medicine is not addictive.
Before you use Enstilar®
When you must not use Enstilar®
Do not use Enstilar® if you:

are allergic to calcipotriol, betamethasone dipropionate or any of the other ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet (see Product description) or any other similar medicine, such as topical corticosteroids
have high blood calcium levels (ask your doctor)
have other types of psoriasis known as generalised pustular or erythrodermic exfoliative psoriasis (your doctor will identify these conditions for you)

Some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction include shortness of breath, wheezing or difficulty breathing; swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body; rash, itching or “hives” on the skin.
Do not use Enstilar® on skin affected by:

viral, fungal, bacterial or parasitic skin infections
tuberculosis (TB)
perioral dermatitis (red rash around the mouth)
thin skin, easily damaged skin, stretch marks
ichthyosis (dry skin with fish like scales)
acne
rosacea
ulcers or broken skin

Inform your doctor if you are suffering from any illness before using Enstilar®.
Do not use Enstilar®

after the expiry date printed on the pack OR
if the can has been opened for more than 6 months OR
if the packaging is torn, doesn’t look quite right or shows signs of tampering.

If any of these apply, return the medicine to your pharmacist for disposal.
If you are not sure whether you should start using Enstilar®, talk to your doctor.
Before you start to use it
Tell your doctor if you have a known allergy to Enstilar® calcipotriol, betamethasone dipropionate or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet.
Tell your doctor if you

are pregnant
are breast-feeding
intend to breast feed.

Do not use Enstilar® in children. Safety and effectiveness of Enstilar® in those below 18 years of age has not been established.
If you have not told your doctor about any of the above, tell him/her before you start using this medicine.
Other medicines
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using any other medicines, including any that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.
Your doctor and pharmacist have more information on medicines you should be careful with or avoid whilst using Enstilar®.
How to use Enstilar®
Caution: Extremely flammable. Please read important information under ‘Storage’.
Follow carefully all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.
If you do not understand the instructions in this leaflet, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.
Enstilar® is for topical use (on the skin). Before use, read the patient information, even if you have used Enstilar® before. Enstilar® is designed for direct application (spray on) to your skin, where it is affected by psoriasis.
Important: Do not use more than 15g in one day. 15g corresponds to the amount sprayed from the can when the actuator is fully pressed down for 1 minute. Do not use more than 100g in one week.
For example, no more than 2 cans in one week. One 60g can should last you at least 4 days.
If you also use other calcipotriol containing products (e.g.: Daivobet® gel or ointment, Daivonex®) for your psoriasis, then the total amount of calcipotriol products must not exceed 15g per day or 100 grams per week.
NOTE: If you use more than the recommended amount of Enstilar®, the levels of calcium in your blood may rise. This is known as “hypercalcaemia”.
Hypercalcaemia:

is measured by a blood test
may be harmful
may mean that Enstilar® or any other product containing calcipotriol (e.g.: Daivobet® gel or ointment, Daivonex®) should not be used until the calcium level has become normal again.

Blood calcium levels will quickly normalise when your doctor discontinues Enstilar® treatment.
How to use Enstilar®
Enstilar® should be applied to dry skin on the affected areas of the body.

Shake the can before use and remove the cap.



Apply the medication by holding the can at least 3cm (approximately 1.5 inches) from the skin and spray onto the affected area.



The foam can be sprayed by holding the can in any orientation except horizontally. Apply a layer of foam only to the psoriasis plaques. Spray directly onto each affected skin area and gently rub in. If you accidentally put some of the foam on normal skin, wipe it off as soon as possible.



Gently rub the foam into your affected skin areas
You will need to repeat steps 1 to 4 until all of the affected areas are covered.



After applying your medication, put the cap back on the can to prevent accidental pressing of the can when not in use.
Wash your hands well after using Enstilar® (unless you are using the foam to treat your hands). This will avoid accidentally spreading the foam to other parts of your body (especially face, mouth and eyes).
Take care not to get the foam spray in your eyes. If this happens, rinse your eyes with clean water and seek medical advice.
If you accidentally put some of the foam onto skin not affected by psoriasis, wipe it off as soon as possible.
Do not bandage, tightly cover or wrap the treated area

For best results leave on during the day or night. The treated area does not need to be covered. You may wear your usual clothes however avoid contact with fabric that is easily stained by grease (e.g. silk).
Do not use Enstilar®

on large areas of damaged skin;
in skin folds (eg. groin, underarm);
on the genitalia;
inside the mouth, nose or in the eyes;
on the face (an itchy red rash may develop).
under occlusive dressings (such as a bandage).

Wash your hands thoroughly after applying Enstilar® on any part of your body, unless your hands are being treated.
Thoroughly wash your hands prior to handling infants or children.
If any skin irritation develops, wash off the Enstilar®.
When to use Enstilar®
Apply Enstilar® once a day at the most convenient time for you, trying to applying it about the same time of the day each day (for example, morning, afternoon or evening).
As a guide on how much Enstilar® to use: A short 2 second spray of Enstilar® provides 0.5g of the medication and this amount should be sufficient to cover an area of skin roughly corresponding to the area of an adult hand.
How long to use it
Each treatment course would normally last for up to four weeks.
Your doctor may decide to stop treatment with Enstilar® once your psoriasis has improved, and to recommence it as needed. Your doctor may decide on a different treatment period and/or repeated treatment.
If you forget to use it
If you forget to use Enstilar®, use it as soon as you remember, then continue as before. Do not use an increased dose of the foam to make up for the forgotten doses.
If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
If you have trouble remembering to use your medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist for some hints.
If you use too much or use it other than directed (Overdose)
Immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26 in Australia) for advice, or go to the Emergency Department at the nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have used too much or swallowed some of this medicine. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. You may need urgent medical attention.
While you are using Enstilar®
Things you must do
While you are using Enstilar®, protect the treated skin areas from sunlight and Ultraviolet (UV) rays, for example, by wearing protective clothing. This is particularly important if your job or lifestyle means you spend time outdoors
If you are going to start any new medicine, tell your doctor and pharmacist that you are using Enstilar®.
If you become pregnant while using Enstilar®, tell your doctor immediately.
Keep all appointments with your doctor so that your progress can be checked. Your doctor may do blood tests whilst you are using Enstilar® (or any other product containing calcipotriol, for example Daivobet® gel or ointment, Daivonex®). These tests check the levels of calcium in your blood and how well your kidneys are working (“renal function”).
Things you must not do
Do not give your medicine to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.
Do not use more than the recommended daily or weekly dose (see How to use Enstilar®).
Do not use other topical corticosteroids (e.g. Advantan®, Diprosone®, Elocon®) on areas treated with Enstilar®.
Side effects
As with all medicines, Enstilar® can cause some side effects.
Do not be alarmed by the following list of side effects. You may not experience any of them.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist:

if you have any unpleasant effects while you are using Enstilar®
or
if you notice any of the following and they worry you: 
- skin irritation (including itching, redness, burning, dryness, pain, swelling or peeling)
- a rash on your face or body
- a change in the colour of your skin
- your skin is more sensitive to light
- change in control of diabetes

Enstilar® contains butylated hydroxytoluene (E321). This may cause local skin reactions (e.g. contact dermatitis), or irritation to the eyes and mucous membranes.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice anything that is making you feel unwell. Other side effects not listed above may also occur in some people.
After using Enstilar®
Keep Enstilar® in the box until required.
Storage
Keep Enstilar® in a cool dry place, store below 25°C.
CAUTION: Extremely flammable Pressurised container: May burst if heated. Protect from sunlight and do not expose to temperatures above 50°C. Do not pierce or burn, even after use. Do not spray on an open flame or other ignition source. Keep away from sparks, open flames and other ignition sources.
Do not smoke while applying Enstilar®.
Keep Enstilar® in the box to protect from light.
Keep Enstilar® where children cannot reach it. A locked cupboard at least one-and-a-half metres above the ground is a good place to store medicines.

<h2>What is in this leaflet</h2>
<p>Please read this leaflet carefully before you use your medicine.</p>
<p>This leaflet answers some common questions about Ventolin Nebules. It does not contain all the available information.</p>
<p>It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking Ventolin Nebules against the benefits they expect it will have for you.</p>

<p><strong>Keep this leaflet with the medicine.</strong> You may need to read it again.</p>
<h2>What Ventolin Nebules are used for</h2>
<p>Ventolin Nebules help you breathe more easily. When your chest is tight or when you are wheezing, Ventolin opens up the breathing tubes in your lungs.</p>
<p>Your medicine is known as a bronchodilator. Because the medicine in your Ventolin Nebules gives fast relief from your chest symptoms, it is often called a 'reliever'. There are other types of medicines that prevent wheezing or chest tightness. These medicines are called 'preventers' and must be used every day. Your doctor may tell you to use a 'preventer' in addition to your Ventolin Nebules.</p>
<p><strong>Ventolin Nebules are not the only form of Ventolin available. Your doctor will decide which form of Ventolin is right for you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you.</strong> Your doctor may have prescribed it for another reason.</p>
<h2>Before you use Ventolin Nebules</h2>
<h3><em>When you must not take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not take Ventolin Nebules if you have an allergy to salbutamol sulfate or any of the other ingredients in Ventolin Nebules (see Ingredients).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not take Ventolin Nebules to stop a miscarriage or premature labour.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not take this medicine after the expiry date printed on the pack has passed or if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering.</strong> If it has expired or is damaged, return it to your pharmacist for disposal.</p>
<p><strong>If you are not sure whether you should start taking this medicine, talk to your doctor.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Before you start to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>You must tell your doctor if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>you are allergic to foods, dyes, preservatives or any other medicines</li>
<li>you have had to stop taking this or any other asthma medicine for any reason</li>
<li>you have been diagnosed with a thyroid condition</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or are breast-feeding.</strong></p>
<p>The ingredients of Ventolin Nebules are known to cross the placenta during pregnancy. Your doctor can discuss with you the risks and benefits involved.</p>
<p>It is not known whether the ingredients of Ventolin Nebules can pass into breast milk. If you are breast-feeding, you must check with your doctor before you take Ventolin Nebules.</p>
<p><strong>If you have not told your doctor about any of the above, tell him/her before you start taking Ventolin Nebules.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Taking other medicines</em></h3>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, including any that you get without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.</strong></p>
<p>Some medicines may interfere with Ventolin Nebules. Your doctor and pharmacist have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while taking this medicine.</p>
<h2>How to take Ventolin Nebules</h2>
<p><strong>Follow all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist carefully.</strong> They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not understand the instructions on the box, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How much to take</em></h3>
<p>Take Ventolin Nebules as directed by your doctor or pharmacist. The pharmacist's label will usually tell you how many Ventolin Nebules should be taken. If you are not sure, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>Adults: one 5 mg Nebule via nebuliser every 4-6 hours as necessary.</p>
<p>Children (4-12 years): one 2.5 mg Nebule via nebuliser every 4-6 hours as necessary.</p>
<p>Initial doses in the elderly may be lower than the recommended adult dose.</p>
<p>If your condition suddenly gets worse, your doctor may tell you to increase your dose.</p>
<h3><em>How to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Ventolin Nebules must only be used by inhalation from a nebuliser and must not be injected or swallowed.</strong>The nebuliser produces a fine mist which you breathe in through a face mask or a mouthpiece. Make sure you know how to use it properly. If you have problems ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p><strong>Do not let the liquid, or the mist produced by the nebuliser get into your eyes.</strong> You can wear glasses or goggles to protect them.</p>
<p>Use your nebuliser in a well ventilated room as some of the mist will be released into the air and may be breathed in by others.</p>
<p><strong>Any solution remaining in the nebuliser should be discarded after use.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How long to take it</em></h3>
<p>Your doctor will decide how often and for how long you have to take Ventolin Nebules. The pharmacist's label will usually tell you how often to take Ventolin Nebules. If you are not sure, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p><strong>Do not stop taking Ventolin Nebules, or change the dose without first checking with your doctor.</strong></p>
<h3><em>If you forget to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not take an extra dose to make up for a missed dose. This may increase the chance of you getting unwanted side effects.</strong> Just take your next dose at the usual time. If you become wheezy or develop other symptoms of an asthma attack you may need to take your next dose earlier.</p>
<p><strong>If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints.</strong></p>
<h3><em>If you take too much (overdose)</em></h3>
<p><strong>Immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (In Australia call 13 11 26) for advice, or go to Accident and Emergency at the nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have taken too many Ventolin Nebules. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.</strong> You may need urgent medical attention.</p>
<p>Symptoms of an overdose may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>rapid heart beat</li>
<li>significant muscle tremor</li>
<li>increased acid in the blood, which may cause an increased rate of breathing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>While you are using Ventolin Nebules</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p><strong>If you are about to be started on any new medicine, remind your doctor or pharmacist that you are taking Ventolin Nebules.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell any other doctors, dentists, and pharmacists who treat you that you are taking this medicine.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are going to have surgery, tell the surgeon or anaesthetist that you are taking this medicine.</strong> It may affect other medicines used during surgery.</p>
<p><strong>If you become pregnant while taking this medicine, tell your doctor immediately.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are about to have any blood tests, tell your doctor that you are taking this medicine.</strong> It may interfere with the results of some tests.</p>
<p><strong>Keep all of your doctor's appointments so that your progress can be checked.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If your Ventolin Nebules do not help your breathing as much as usual, tell your doctor as soon as possible.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If the effect of your Ventolin Nebules does not last as long as usual, tell your doctor as soon as possible.</strong></p>
<p>These may be signs that your chest condition is getting worse.</p>
<p>If your Ventolin Nebules are not having the same effect as before, your doctor may decide to prescribe other forms of Ventolin, or another medicine, for you to use.</p>
<p>This medicine is only one part of a general plan to help you manage your asthma or other chest condition. You should discuss this plan with your doctor. Ask your doctor to check your treatment regularly.</p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not take Ventolin Nebules to treat any other complaints unless your doctor tells you to.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not give your medicine to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not stop taking your medicine or lower the dosage without checking with your doctor.</strong> If you stop taking it suddenly, your condition may worsen or you may have unwanted side effects.</p>

If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Keep this leaflet with the medicine. You may need to read it again.
What Ventolin Nebules are used for
Ventolin Nebules help you breathe more easily. When your chest is tight or when you are wheezing, Ventolin opens up the breathing tubes in your lungs.
Your medicine is known as a bronchodilator. Because the medicine in your Ventolin Nebules gives fast relief from your chest symptoms, it is often called a 'reliever'. There are other types of medicines that prevent wheezing or chest tightness. These medicines are called 'preventers' and must be used every day. Your doctor may tell you to use a 'preventer' in addition to your Ventolin Nebules.
Ventolin Nebules are not the only form of Ventolin available. Your doctor will decide which form of Ventolin is right for you.
Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you. Your doctor may have prescribed it for another reason.

Some medicines may interfere with Ventolin Nebules. Your doctor and pharmacist have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while taking this medicine.
How to take Ventolin Nebules
Follow all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist carefully. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.
If you do not understand the instructions on the box, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.
How much to take
Take Ventolin Nebules as directed by your doctor or pharmacist. The pharmacist's label will usually tell you how many Ventolin Nebules should be taken. If you are not sure, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Adults: one 5 mg Nebule via nebuliser every 4-6 hours as necessary.
Children (4-12 years): one 2.5 mg Nebule via nebuliser every 4-6 hours as necessary.
Initial doses in the elderly may be lower than the recommended adult dose.
If your condition suddenly gets worse, your doctor may tell you to increase your dose.
How to take it
Ventolin Nebules must only be used by inhalation from a nebuliser and must not be injected or swallowed.The nebuliser produces a fine mist which you breathe in through a face mask or a mouthpiece. Make sure you know how to use it properly. If you have problems ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Do not let the liquid, or the mist produced by the nebuliser get into your eyes. You can wear glasses or goggles to protect them.
Use your nebuliser in a well ventilated room as some of the mist will be released into the air and may be breathed in by others.
Any solution remaining in the nebuliser should be discarded after use.
How long to take it
Your doctor will decide how often and for how long you have to take Ventolin Nebules. The pharmacist's label will usually tell you how often to take Ventolin Nebules. If you are not sure, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Do not stop taking Ventolin Nebules, or change the dose without first checking with your doctor.
If you forget to take it
Do not take an extra dose to make up for a missed dose. This may increase the chance of you getting unwanted side effects. Just take your next dose at the usual time. If you become wheezy or develop other symptoms of an asthma attack you may need to take your next dose earlier.
If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints.
If you take too much (overdose)
Immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (In Australia call 13 11 26) for advice, or go to Accident and Emergency at the nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have taken too many Ventolin Nebules. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. You may need urgent medical attention.
Symptoms of an overdose may include:

rapid heart beat
significant muscle tremor
increased acid in the blood, which may cause an increased rate of breathing.

While you are using Ventolin Nebules
Things you must do
If you are about to be started on any new medicine, remind your doctor or pharmacist that you are taking Ventolin Nebules.

If your Ventolin Nebules do not help your breathing as much as usual, tell your doctor as soon as possible.
If the effect of your Ventolin Nebules does not last as long as usual, tell your doctor as soon as possible.
These may be signs that your chest condition is getting worse.
If your Ventolin Nebules are not having the same effect as before, your doctor may decide to prescribe other forms of Ventolin, or another medicine, for you to use.
This medicine is only one part of a general plan to help you manage your asthma or other chest condition. You should discuss this plan with your doctor. Ask your doctor to check your treatment regularly.
Things you must not do

<h2>What APO-CLONIDINE is used for</h2>
<p>APO-CLONIDINE lowers high blood pressure, also called hypertension.</p>
<p>Everyone has blood pressure. This pressure helps your blood move around your body. Your blood pressure may be different at different times of the day. You have hypertension when your blood pressure stays higher than normal, even when you are calm or relaxed.</p>
<p>There are usually no signs of hypertension. The only way of knowing that you have hypertension is to have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. You may feel fine and have no symptoms, but if high blood pressure is not treated, it can lead to serious health problems (such as heart disease).</p>
<p>APO-CLONIDINE works by relaxing and widening blood vessels and so helps to lower your blood pressure.</p>
<p>APO-CLONIDINE is also used to prevent migraine headache and to relieve symptoms of menopausal flushing.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why APO-CLONIDINE has been prescribed for you.</strong> Your doctor may have prescribed APO-CLONIDINE for another reason.</p>

<p><strong>This medicine should not be given to a child under the age of 18 years.</strong> Serious side effects have been observed when clonidine, the active ingredient in APO-CLONIDINE, is used with methylphenidate in children with ADHD. Therefore, APO-CLONIDINE in this combination is not recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Do not take APO-CLONIDINE after the expiry date printed on the carton or blister strips or if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering.</strong> If it has expired or is damaged, return it to your pharmacist for disposal.</p>
<p><strong>If you are not sure whether you should start taking this medicine, talk to your doctor.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Before you are given it</em></h3>

<p>Your doctor and pharmacist have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while being given this medicine.</p>
<h2>How APO-CLONIDINE is given</h2>
<p><strong>Follow all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist carefully.</strong> They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not understand the instructions, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How much to take</em></h3>
<p>Your doctor will tell you how much of your medicine you need to take every day. This depends on your condition and whether you are taking other medicines.</p>
<p>The usual starting dose for high blood pressure is 50 micrograms (half a tablet), two or three times a day. Your doctor may increase the daily dosage by half-tablet increments, depending on how your blood pressure responds. For migraine and menopausal flushing the usual starting dose is 25 micrograms two times a day. Your doctor may increase this to 50 micrograms two times a day. If necessary, your doctor may increase this to a total daily dose of 150 micrograms.</p>
<h3><em>How to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Swallow the tablets with a full glass of water.</strong></p>
<h3><em>When to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Take your medicine at about the same time each day.</strong> Taking it at the same time each day will have the best effect. It will also help you remember when to take it.</p>
<h3><em>How long to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Continue taking APO-CLONIDINE for as long as your doctor tells you.</strong></p>
<p>APO-CLONIDINE helps to control your condition, but does not cure it. It is important to keep taking your medicine even if you feel well.</p>
<p><strong>If your doctor tells you to stop taking APO-CLONIDINE, you should reduce the dose of medicine gradually over a period of a week or more.</strong> This is to avoid a sudden increase in your blood pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any concerns.</strong></p>
<h3><em>If you forget to take it</em></h3>
<p>It is important to take APO-CLONIDINE as directed.</p>
<p><strong>If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However, if you remember when it is almost time for your next dose, take only your usual dose at that time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints.</strong></p>
<h3><em>If you take too much (overdose)</em></h3>
<p><strong>Immediately telephone your doctor or Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26) for advice, or go to Emergency at your nearest hospital, if you have taken more than the recommended or prescribed dose of APO-CLONIDINE. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.</strong> You may need urgent medical attention.</p>
<p>Signs of overdose may include slow heart beat, drowsiness, temporarily stopping breathing and coma. Other signs include dizziness, weakness, lethargy, feeling cold, vomiting, looking pale, or having an irregular heart beat.</p>
<h2>While you are being given APO-CLONIDINE</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p><strong>If you are about to be started on any new medicine, tell your doctor and pharmacist that you are taking APO-CLONIDINE.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell any other doctors, dentists and pharmacists who treat you that you are taking APO-CLONIDINE.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are going to have surgery, tell the surgeon or anaesthetist that you are taking APO-CLONIDINE.</strong> It may affect other medicines used during surgery.</p>
<p><strong>If you become pregnant while taking APO-CLONIDINE, tell your doctor immediately.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Have your blood pressure checked as instructed by your doctor, to make sure APO-CLONIDINE is working.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if, for any reason, you have not taken APO-CLONIDINE exactly as prescribed.</strong> Otherwise, your doctor may think that it was not effective and change your treatment unnecessarily.</p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not take APO-CLONIDINE to treat any other complaints unless your doctor tells you to.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not give APO-CLONIDINE to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not stop taking your medicine or lower the dosage without checking with your doctor.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things to be careful of</em></h3>
<p><strong>Be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how APO-CLONIDINE affects you.</strong> APO-CLONIDINE, like other medicines used to treat high blood pressure, may cause dizziness or drowsiness in some people. Make sure you know how you react to APO-CLONIDINE before you drive or operate machinery.</p>
<p><strong>If you feel light-headed, dizzy or faint, get up slowly when getting out of bed or standing up.</strong> You may feel light-headed or dizzy when you begin to take APO- CLONIDINE or if the dose is increased. This is because your blood pressure is falling suddenly. Standing up slowly will help your body get used to the change in position and blood pressure. The problem usually goes away after the first few days.</p>
<h2>Side effects</h2>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking APO-CLONIDINE.</strong></p>
<p>All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical attention if you get some of the side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Do not be alarmed by the following list of side effects. You may not experience any of them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.</strong></p>
<p>The more frequently reported side effects of APO-CLONIDINE are lightheadedness when you stand up suddenly, drowsiness, dryness of the mouth, nausea and vomiting.</p>
<p>Less frequently reported side effects of APO-CLONIDINE include the following:</p>

If necessary, your doctor may increase this to a total daily dose of 150 micrograms.
How to take it
Swallow the tablets with a full glass of water.
When to take it
Take your medicine at about the same time each day. Taking it at the same time each day will have the best effect. It will also help you remember when to take it.
How long to take it
Continue taking APO-CLONIDINE for as long as your doctor tells you.
APO-CLONIDINE helps to control your condition, but does not cure it. It is important to keep taking your medicine even if you feel well.
If your doctor tells you to stop taking APO-CLONIDINE, you should reduce the dose of medicine gradually over a period of a week or more. This is to avoid a sudden increase in your blood pressure.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any concerns.
If you forget to take it
It is important to take APO-CLONIDINE as directed.
If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. However, if you remember when it is almost time for your next dose, take only your usual dose at that time.
Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed.
If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints.
If you take too much (overdose)
Immediately telephone your doctor or Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26) for advice, or go to Emergency at your nearest hospital, if you have taken more than the recommended or prescribed dose of APO-CLONIDINE. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. You may need urgent medical attention.
Signs of overdose may include slow heart beat, drowsiness, temporarily stopping breathing and coma. Other signs include dizziness, weakness, lethargy, feeling cold, vomiting, looking pale, or having an irregular heart beat.
While you are being given APO-CLONIDINE
Things you must do
If you are about to be started on any new medicine, tell your doctor and pharmacist that you are taking APO-CLONIDINE.
Tell any other doctors, dentists and pharmacists who treat you that you are taking APO-CLONIDINE.
If you are going to have surgery, tell the surgeon or anaesthetist that you are taking APO-CLONIDINE. It may affect other medicines used during surgery.
If you become pregnant while taking APO-CLONIDINE, tell your doctor immediately.
Have your blood pressure checked as instructed by your doctor, to make sure APO-CLONIDINE is working.
Tell your doctor if, for any reason, you have not taken APO-CLONIDINE exactly as prescribed. Otherwise, your doctor may think that it was not effective and change your treatment unnecessarily.
Things you must not do
Do not take APO-CLONIDINE to treat any other complaints unless your doctor tells you to.
Do not give APO-CLONIDINE to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.
Do not stop taking your medicine or lower the dosage without checking with your doctor.
Things to be careful of
Be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how APO-CLONIDINE affects you. APO-CLONIDINE, like other medicines used to treat high blood pressure, may cause dizziness or drowsiness in some people. Make sure you know how you react to APO-CLONIDINE before you drive or operate machinery.
If you feel light-headed, dizzy or faint, get up slowly when getting out of bed or standing up. You may feel light-headed or dizzy when you begin to take APO- CLONIDINE or if the dose is increased. This is because your blood pressure is falling suddenly. Standing up slowly will help your body get used to the change in position and blood pressure. The problem usually goes away after the first few days.
Side effects
Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking APO-CLONIDINE.
All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical attention if you get some of the side effects.
Do not be alarmed by the following list of side effects. You may not experience any of them.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.
The more frequently reported side effects of APO-CLONIDINE are lightheadedness when you stand up suddenly, drowsiness, dryness of the mouth, nausea and vomiting.
Less frequently reported side effects of APO-CLONIDINE include the following:

blurred vision
dizziness
confusion
headache
sleep disturbances
mental depression
irrational or abnormal thoughts
irritability
decreased sexual drive / impotence
generally feeling unwell
thinning of hair
rash / hives / itching
constipation
dryness of the nose and eyes
pain in the salivary glands
tingling or numbness of the hands or feet
larger breasts than normal, in men
slow or irregular heart beat
blood glucose increased.

Occasional reports of abnormal liver function tests and cases of hepatitis have also been reported.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you experience any side effects during or after taking APO-CLONIDINE, so that these may be properly treated.
Other side effects not listed above may also occur in some people.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice anything unusual, during or after taking APO-CLONIDINE.
After being given APO-CLONIDINE
Storage
Keep your tablets in the blister strip until it is time to take them. The blister strip protects the tablets. If you take the tablets out of the blister strip they may not keep well.

Do not store APO-CLONIDINE or any other medicine in the bathroom or near a sink. Do not leave it in the car or on the window sill. Heat and dampness can destroy some medicines.
Keep it where children cannot reach it. A locked cupboard at least one-and-a-half metres above the ground is a good place to store medicines.

<h2>What is PRO-BANTHINE used for</h2>
<p>The name of your medicine is PRO-BANTHINE.</p>
<p>The active ingredient is called propantheline bromide.</p>
<p>Propantheline bromide belongs to a group of medicines called the anticholinergics.</p>
<p>Anticholinergics are used to reduce both gastric acid and other secretions in the stomach, and to reduce cramps or spasms in the muscles of your stomach, intestine and urinary tract.</p>
<p>PRO-BANTHINE works by stopping some of the actions of a naturally occurring substance called acetylcholine which then reduces:</p>
<ul>
<li>the amount of acid produced by your stomach</li>
<li>cramps or spasms in the muscles of your stomach, intestine and urinary tract</li>

Consumer Medicine Information
What is in this leaflet
This leaflet answers some common questions about PRO-BANTHINE tablets. It does not contain all the available information about this medicine. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.
All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking PRO-BANTHINE against the benefits he or she expects it will have.
If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Keep this leaflet with the medicine. You may need to read it again.
What is PRO-BANTHINE used for
The name of your medicine is PRO-BANTHINE.
The active ingredient is called propantheline bromide.
Propantheline bromide belongs to a group of medicines called the anticholinergics.
Anticholinergics are used to reduce both gastric acid and other secretions in the stomach, and to reduce cramps or spasms in the muscles of your stomach, intestine and urinary tract.
PRO-BANTHINE works by stopping some of the actions of a naturally occurring substance called acetylcholine which then reduces:

the amount of acid produced by your stomach
cramps or spasms in the muscles of your stomach, intestine and urinary tract
the amount of sweat produced by your body.

PRO-BANTHINE is used to treat a number of different conditions:
It reduces:

ulcers in the stomach (gastric ulcers) and in the first part of the intestine (duodenal ulcers) with the assistance of other medicines
urinary problems caused by nerves or muscles that control the bladder
excessive sweating.

Your doctor may have prescribed this medicine for another condition.
Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why PRO-BANTHINE has been prescribed for you.

<h2>How to take NortriTABS</h2>

<p><strong>If you do not understand the instructions on the box, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How much to take</em></h3>
<p>Your doctor will tell you how much NortriTABS you need to take each day.</p>
<p>The usual adult dose for NortriTABS is 75 to 100 mg daily, in 3 or 4 divided doses. For elderly patients, 25 to 50 mg daily in divided doses is recommended.</p>
<p>Your doctor may increase or decrease your dose depending on your condition.</p>
<h3><em>How to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Swallow the tablets whole with a full glass of water.</strong></p>

<p>For depression, the length of treatment will depend on how quickly your symptoms improve. Most antidepressants take time to work so don't be discouraged if you do not feel better right away.

<p><strong>Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints.</strong></p>
<h3><em>If you take too much (overdose)</em></h3>
<p><strong>Immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26) for advice, or go to Accident and Emergency at the nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much NortriTABS. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.</strong> You may need urgent medical attention.</p>
<p>Symptoms of an overdose may include confusion, blurred vision, dizziness, body temperature changes (low and high), difficulty in breathing and increased heartbeat.</p>
<h2>While you are taking NortriTABS</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p><strong>If you are about to be started on any new medicine, remind your doctor and pharmacist that you are taking NortriTABS.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Keep all of your doctor's appointments so that your progress can be checked.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not take NortriTABS to treat any other complaints unless your doctor tells you to.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not give your medicine to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not stop taking your medicine or lower the dosage without checking with your doctor.</strong></p>

<h2>How to take NortriTABS</h2>
<p><strong>Follow all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist carefully.</strong> They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not understand the instructions on the box, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How much to take</em></h3>
<p>Your doctor will tell you how much NortriTABS you need to take each day.</p>
<p>The usual adult dose for NortriTABS is 75 to 100 mg daily, in 3 or 4 divided doses. For elderly patients, 25 to 50 mg daily in divided doses is recommended.</p>
<p>Your doctor may increase or decrease your dose depending on your condition.</p>
<h3><em>How to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Swallow the tablets whole with a full glass of water.</strong></p>
<h3><em>When to take it</em></h3>

<h3><em>How long to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Continue taking your medicine for as long as your doctor tells you.</strong></p>
<p>For depression, the length of treatment will depend on how quickly your symptoms improve. Most antidepressants take time to work so don't be discouraged if you do not feel better right away.

<p><strong>If you do not start to feel better in about 4 weeks, check with your doctor.</strong></p>
<h3><em>If you forget to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Otherwise, take it as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking your medicine as you would normally.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints.</strong></p>
<h3><em>If you take too much (overdose)</em></h3>
<p><strong>Immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26) for advice, or go to Accident and Emergency at the nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much NortriTABS. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.</strong> You may need urgent medical attention.</p>
<p>Symptoms of an overdose may include confusion, blurred vision, dizziness, body temperature changes (low and high), difficulty in breathing and increased heartbeat.</p>
<h2>While you are taking NortriTABS</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>

<p><strong>Consumer Medicine Information</strong></p>
<h2>WHAT IS IN THIS LEAFLET</h2>
<p>This leaflet answers some common questions about PREXUM COMBI. It does not contain all the available information about this medicine. Reading this leaflet does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking PREXUM COMBI against the expected benefits for you.</p>
<p><strong>If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keep this leaflet with the medicine.</strong> You may need to read it again.</p>
<h2>WHAT PREXUM COMBI IS</h2>
<p>The name of your medicine is PREXUM COMBI. The medicine contains the active ingredients perindopril arginine and indapamide hemihydrate. Perindopril belongs to a group of medicines called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Indapamide belongs to a group of medicines called diuretics (a type of ""water"" tablet).</p>
<h2>WHAT PREXUM COMBI IS USED FOR</h2>
<p><strong>You have been prescribed PREXUM COMBI for high blood pressure.</strong></p>
<p>PREXUM COMBI is available only with a doctor's prescription.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that PREXUM COMBI is addictive.</p>
<h3><em>Why PREXUM COMBI is used for high blood pressure</em></h3>
<p>Everyone has blood pressure. This pressure helps to circulate blood all around the body. Your blood pressure may be different at different times of the day, depending on how busy or stressed you are. You have high blood pressure (also known as hypertension) when your blood pressure stays higher than is needed, even when you are calm and relaxed.</p>
<p>If high blood pressure is not treated it can lead to serious health problems. You may feel fine and have no symptoms, but eventually it can cause stroke, heart disease and kidney failure.</p>
<p>PREXUM COMBI helps to lower your blood pressure.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why PREXUM COMBI has been prescribed for you.</strong></p>
<h2>BEFORE YOU TAKE PREXUM COMBI</h2>

<p><strong>PREXUM COMBI is not recommended for use in children and adolescents.</strong></p>
<h2>HOW TO TAKE PREXUM COMBI</h2>
<p><strong>Follow all directions given to you by your doctor and pharmacist carefully.</strong></p>
<p>If you do not understand the instructions on the label, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.</p>
<p>Your doctor will select a dose when they prescribe PREXUM COMBI for you. The usual dose is one tablet once daily.</p>
<p><strong>Swallow your tablet(s) with water, preferably in the morning.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How long to take PREXUM COMBI for</em></h3>
<p>PREXUM COMBI can help to control your blood pressure but cannot cure this condition. PREXUM COMBI treatment is usually for life - so you should keep taking the tablets regularly unless advised otherwise by your doctor.</p>
<h3><em>If you forget to take PREXUM COMBI</em></h3>

<h3><em>If you take too much PREXUM COMBI</em></h3>
<p>Taking too much PREXUM COMBI (an overdose) may cause low blood pressure (also known as hypotension).</p>
<p><strong>The most likely effect in case of overdose is low blood pressure which can make you feel dizzy. If this happens, lying down with the legs elevated can help.</strong></p>

</ul>
<h2>WHILE YOU ARE TAKING PREXUM COMBI</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p>Take PREXUM COMBI exactly as your doctor has prescribed. Otherwise you may not get the benefits from treatment. Tell all doctors, dentists and pharmacists who are involved with your treatment that you are taking PREXUM COMBI.</p>
<p>Make sure you drink enough water during exercise and hot weather especially if you sweat a lot. This will help you avoid any dizziness or light-headedness caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure.</p>
<p>Tell your doctor straight away if you have excessive vomiting or diarrhoea while taking PREXUM COMBI</p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<p>Do not give this medicine to anyone else, even they have the same condition as you.</p>
<p>Do not use PREXUM COMBI to treat any other complaints unless your doctor tells you to.</p>
<p>Do not stop taking PREXUM COMBI or change the dose, without checking with your doctor.</p>
<h3><em>Things to be careful of</em></h3>
<p><strong>Be careful when driving or operating machinery until you know how PREXUM COMBI affects you.</strong> You may feel light-headed or dizzy when you begin to take PREXUM COMBI. This is because your blood pressure is falling. If you have these symptoms when standing up or getting out of bed then getting up more slowly can help. This allows your body to get used to the change in position and blood pressure.</p>
<p><strong>If you have these symptoms and they don't get better in a short time then talk to your doctor.</strong></p>
<h2>SIDE EFFECTS</h2>
<p><strong>If you do not feel well while you are taking PREXUM COMBI then tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible.</strong></p>

Consumer Medicine Information
WHAT IS IN THIS LEAFLET
This leaflet answers some common questions about PREXUM COMBI. It does not contain all the available information about this medicine. Reading this leaflet does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.
All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking PREXUM COMBI against the expected benefits for you.
If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Keep this leaflet with the medicine. You may need to read it again.
WHAT PREXUM COMBI IS
The name of your medicine is PREXUM COMBI. The medicine contains the active ingredients perindopril arginine and indapamide hemihydrate. Perindopril belongs to a group of medicines called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Indapamide belongs to a group of medicines called diuretics (a type of ""water"" tablet).
WHAT PREXUM COMBI IS USED FOR
You have been prescribed PREXUM COMBI for high blood pressure.
PREXUM COMBI is available only with a doctor's prescription.
There is no evidence that PREXUM COMBI is addictive.
Why PREXUM COMBI is used for high blood pressure
Everyone has blood pressure. This pressure helps to circulate blood all around the body. Your blood pressure may be different at different times of the day, depending on how busy or stressed you are. You have high blood pressure (also known as hypertension) when your blood pressure stays higher than is needed, even when you are calm and relaxed.
If high blood pressure is not treated it can lead to serious health problems. You may feel fine and have no symptoms, but eventually it can cause stroke, heart disease and kidney failure.
PREXUM COMBI helps to lower your blood pressure.
Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why PREXUM COMBI has been prescribed for you.
BEFORE YOU TAKE PREXUM COMBI
There are some people who should not take PREXUM COMBI. Please read the lists below. If you think any of these situations apply to you, or you have any questions, please consult your doctor or pharmacist.

You are allergic to another angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor.
You are pregnant or trying to become pregnant.
You are breastfeeding or plan to breast-feed.
You undergo treatments where your blood is treated outside of the body (also known as extracorporeal treatments) that may increase your risk of allergic reactions, treatments such as: 
- renal dialysis or haemofiltration using polyacrylonitrile membranes
- low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis, a technique where LDL is 'filtered' out of a patient's blood, using dextran sulphate.
You are treated with a blood pressure lowering medicine containing aliskiren and have diabetes or impaired kidney function.
You have kidney problems where the blood supply to your kidneys is reduced (renal artery stenosis).
You are suffering from decreases in the amount, or absence of, urine produced by the kidney.
You have narrowing of the main blood vessel leading from the heart and/or heart valve.
If you have low blood potassium.
If you have severe liver disease or suffer from a condition called hepatic encephalopathy (degenerative disease of the brain that occurs as a result of liver disease).
You have experienced serious swelling of the face, tongue, lips or throat either suddenly or in response to another medicine in the past (a rare allergic condition known as angio-oedema).
The packaging is damaged or shows signs of tampering, or the tablets do not look quite right.
The expiry date (EXP) on the pack has passed.

Tell your doctor straight away if:

You are pregnant or become pregnant while taking PREXUM COMBI, as it may cause serious harm to your unborn baby.
You have a severe allergic reaction with swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat which may cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing (angioedema).

You have recently suffered from diarrhoea or vomiting, or are dehydrated.
You are on a salt restricted diet or use salt substitutes which contain potassium.
You have an intolerance to some sugars as PREXUM COMBI contains lactose.
You are of African origin since you may have a higher risk of angioedema and this medicine is less effective in lowering your blood pressure.
You are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:
- an 'angiotensin II receptor blocker' (also known as ARBs or sartans - for example valsartan, telmisartan, irbesartan), in particular if you have diabetes-related kidney problems

Things to be careful of
Be careful when driving or operating machinery until you know how PREXUM COMBI affects you. You may feel light-headed or dizzy when you begin to take PREXUM COMBI. This is because your blood pressure is falling. If you have these symptoms when standing up or getting out of bed then getting up more slowly can help. This allows your body to get used to the change in position and blood pressure.
If you have these symptoms and they don't get better in a short time then talk to your doctor.
SIDE EFFECTS
If you do not feel well while you are taking PREXUM COMBI then tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible.

<ul>

<h2>What this medicine is used for</h2>
<p>The name of your medicine is APO-Candesartan HCTZ tablets. It contains the active ingredients candesartan cilexetil and hydrochlorothiazide.</p>
<p>It is used to treat:</p>
<ul>
<li>high blood pressure, also called hypertension.</li>
</ul>

<p>This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription.</p>
<h3><em>How it works</em></h3>
<p>Candesartan cilexetil is a type of medicine called an angiotensin II receptor inhibitor (or antagonist). It mainly works by causing relaxation of blood vessels.</p>

What this medicine is used for

Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you.
Your doctor may have prescribed this medicine for another reason.
This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription.
How it works
Candesartan cilexetil is a type of medicine called an angiotensin II receptor inhibitor (or antagonist). It mainly works by causing relaxation of blood vessels.

<p><strong>Consumer Medicine Information</strong></p>
<h2>What is in this leaflet</h2>
<p>This leaflet answers some common questions about Cadivast.</p>
<p>It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>All medicines have benefits and risks. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking Cadivast against the benefits expected for you.</p>
<p><strong>If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keep this leaflet with your medicine.</strong> You may need to read it again.</p>
<h2>What Cadivast is used for</h2>
<p>Cadivast is used to treat:</p>
<ul>
<li>high blood pressure and high cholesterol (fat in the blood).</li>
<li>angina (a certain type of chest pain).</li>
<li>people who have high blood pressure and coronary heart disease (CHD) or who are at risk of CHD (for example, if they have diabetes, a history of stroke, or small blood vessel disease). In these people, Caduet is used to help reduce the risk of having a heart attack or stroke.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cadivast contains a combination of two medicines. One is amlodipine and the other is atorvastatin.</p>
<p>Amlodipine belongs to a group of medicines called calcium channel blockers. They work by relaxing your blood vessels, making it easier for your heart to pump blood around the body and help increase the supply of blood and oxygen to your heart. Calcium channel blockers do not change the amount of calcium in your blood or bones.</p>
<p>Atorvastatin belongs to a group of medicines called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. It works by reducing the amount of cholesterol made by the liver. It reduces the 'bad' cholesterol and can raise the 'good' cholesterol. Atorvastatin also helps to protect you from a heart attack or stroke.</p>
<p>Cadivast may be used alone, or in combination with other medicines, to treat your condition.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you.</strong></p>
<p>Your doctor may have prescribed it for another reason.</p>

Consumer Medicine Information
What is in this leaflet
This leaflet answers some common questions about Cadivast.
It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.
All medicines have benefits and risks. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking Cadivast against the benefits expected for you.
If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
Keep this leaflet with your medicine. You may need to read it again.
What Cadivast is used for
Cadivast is used to treat:

high blood pressure and high cholesterol (fat in the blood).
angina (a certain type of chest pain).
people who have high blood pressure and coronary heart disease (CHD) or who are at risk of CHD (for example, if they have diabetes, a history of stroke, or small blood vessel disease). In these people, Caduet is used to help reduce the risk of having a heart attack or stroke.

Cadivast contains a combination of two medicines. One is amlodipine and the other is atorvastatin.
Amlodipine belongs to a group of medicines called calcium channel blockers. They work by relaxing your blood vessels, making it easier for your heart to pump blood around the body and help increase the supply of blood and oxygen to your heart. Calcium channel blockers do not change the amount of calcium in your blood or bones.
Atorvastatin belongs to a group of medicines called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. It works by reducing the amount of cholesterol made by the liver. It reduces the 'bad' cholesterol and can raise the 'good' cholesterol. Atorvastatin also helps to protect you from a heart attack or stroke.
Cadivast may be used alone, or in combination with other medicines, to treat your condition.
Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you.
Your doctor may have prescribed it for another reason.

While you are taking Cadivast
Things you must do

If you feel light-headed, dizzy or faint when getting out of bed or standing up, get up slowly. Standing up slowly, especially when you get up from bed or chairs, will help your body get used to the change in position and blood pressure. If this problem continues or gets worse, talk to your doctor.

By following these simple measures, you can further reduce the risk from heart disease.

Quit smoking and avoid second-hand smoke.
Limit alcohol intake.
Enjoy healthy eating by:
- eating plenty of vegetables and fruit;
- reducing your saturated fat intake (eat less fatty meats, full fat dairy products, butter, coconut and palm oils, most take-away foods, commercially-baked products).
Be active. Progress, over time, to at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity on 5 or more days each week. Can be accumulated in shorter bouts of 10 minutes duration. If you have been prescribed anti-angina medicine, carry it with you when being physically active.
Maintain a healthy weight.
Discuss your lifestyle and lifestyle plans with your doctor.
For more information and tools to improve your heart health, call Heartline, the Heart Foundation's national telephone information service, on 1300 36 27 87 (local call cost).

Know warning signs of heart attack and what to do:

Tightness, fullness, pressure, squeezing, heaviness or pain in your chest, neck, jaw, throat, shoulders, arms or back.
You may also have difficulty breathing, or have a cold sweat or feel dizzy or light headed or feel like vomiting (or actually vomit).
If you have heart attack warning signs that are severe, get worse or last for 10 minutes even if they are mild, call triple zero (000). Every minute counts.

<h2>What this medicine is used for</h2>

<h2>What this medicine is used for</h2>
<p>The name of your medicine is APO-Candesartan. It contains the active ingredient candesartan cilexetil.</p>
<p>It is used to treat:</p>
<ul>
<li>high blood pressure, also called hypertension.</li>
<li>heart failure - increase survival, reduce hospitalisation and improve symptoms. It is used in combination with other medicines to treat your condition.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you.</p>
<p>Your doctor may have prescribed this medicine for another reason.</p>
<p>This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that this medicine is addictive.</p>
<h3><em>How it works</em></h3>
<p>Candesartan is a type of medicine called an angiotensin II receptor inhibitor (or antagonist).</p>
<p><strong>Hypertension:</strong> <br>
All people have blood pressure. This pressure helps to push blood all around your body. Your blood pressure changes during the day, depending on how busy you are or how you are feeling.</br></p>
<p>You have hypertension (high blood pressure) when your blood pressure stays higher than is needed, even when you are calm and relaxed.</p>
<p>Regular blood pressure checks are the only way of knowing that you have hypertension. There are usually no symptoms of hypertension and you may feel fine. If hypertension is not treated, serious health problems such as stroke or heart attack and heart or kidney failure may occur.</p>
<p>Candesartan lowers blood pressure by dilating (expanding) small blood vessels from the heart, letting the blood be pumped around the body more easily.</p>
<p><strong>Heart Failure:</strong> <br>
Heart failure means that the heart muscle cannot pump blood strongly enough to supply all the blood needed throughout the body. Heart failure is not the same as heart attack and does not mean that the heart stops working.</br></p>
<p>Heart failure may start off with no symptoms, but as the condition progresses, patients may feel short of breath or may get tired easily after light physical activity such as walking. Some patients may wake up short of breath at night. Fluid may collect in different parts of the body, often first noticed as swollen ankles and feet.</p>
<p>Candesartan helps to treat heart failure and may improve your symptoms.</p>
<p>One of the ways candesartan helps heart failure is that it widens the blood vessels, so that the heart does not have to pump as hard to move the blood around the body. This also means that when you place extra demands on your heart, such as during exercise, the heart may cope better so you may not get short of breath as easily.</p>
<p>When used to treat heart failure, candesartan is almost always used with other medicines called diuretics or fluid tablets. These medicines help the kidney to get rid of excess fluid from the body.</p>
<h3><em>Use in children</em></h3>
<p>There is no information about its use in children, so candesartan is not recommended for children.</p>
<h2>Before you use this medicine</h2>
<h3><em>When you must not use it</em></h3>

Symptoms of an allergic reaction may include: shortness of breath, wheezing or difficulty breathing; swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat or other parts of the body; rash, itching or hives on the skin.<br/>
<strong>If you think you are having an allergic reaction, contact your doctor immediately or go to the Accident and Emergency department at the nearest hospital.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do not use candesartan if you are also taking aliskiren-containing medications and have kidney problems or diabetes.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do not use candesartan if you have severe hepatic impairment and/or cholestasis (a condition where bile does not flow from the liver).</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do not use candesartan if you are pregnant.</strong> <br/>
It may affect your baby if you take it during pregnancy.</li>
<li><strong>Do not breast-feed if you are taking candesartan.</strong> <br/>

<li><strong>Do not use this medicine if the expiry date (EXP) printed on the pack has passed.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do not use this medicine if the packaging is torn, shows signs of tampering or it does not look quite right.</strong></li>

All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you using this medicine against the benefits they expect it will have for you.
Pharmaceutical companies cannot give you medical advice or an individual diagnosis.
Keep this leaflet with your medicine. You may want to read it again.
What this medicine is used for
The name of your medicine is APO-Candesartan. It contains the active ingredient candesartan cilexetil.
It is used to treat:

high blood pressure, also called hypertension.
heart failure - increase survival, reduce hospitalisation and improve symptoms. It is used in combination with other medicines to treat your condition.

Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you.
Your doctor may have prescribed this medicine for another reason.
This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription.
There is no evidence that this medicine is addictive.
How it works
Candesartan is a type of medicine called an angiotensin II receptor inhibitor (or antagonist).
Hypertension: 
All people have blood pressure. This pressure helps to push blood all around your body. Your blood pressure changes during the day, depending on how busy you are or how you are feeling.
You have hypertension (high blood pressure) when your blood pressure stays higher than is needed, even when you are calm and relaxed.
Regular blood pressure checks are the only way of knowing that you have hypertension. There are usually no symptoms of hypertension and you may feel fine. If hypertension is not treated, serious health problems such as stroke or heart attack and heart or kidney failure may occur.
Candesartan lowers blood pressure by dilating (expanding) small blood vessels from the heart, letting the blood be pumped around the body more easily.
Heart Failure: 
Heart failure means that the heart muscle cannot pump blood strongly enough to supply all the blood needed throughout the body. Heart failure is not the same as heart attack and does not mean that the heart stops working.
Heart failure may start off with no symptoms, but as the condition progresses, patients may feel short of breath or may get tired easily after light physical activity such as walking. Some patients may wake up short of breath at night. Fluid may collect in different parts of the body, often first noticed as swollen ankles and feet.
Candesartan helps to treat heart failure and may improve your symptoms.
One of the ways candesartan helps heart failure is that it widens the blood vessels, so that the heart does not have to pump as hard to move the blood around the body. This also means that when you place extra demands on your heart, such as during exercise, the heart may cope better so you may not get short of breath as easily.
When used to treat heart failure, candesartan is almost always used with other medicines called diuretics or fluid tablets. These medicines help the kidney to get rid of excess fluid from the body.
Use in children
There is no information about its use in children, so candesartan is not recommended for children.
Before you use this medicine
When you must not use it
Do not use this medicine if you have an allergy to:

If you think you are having an allergic reaction, contact your doctor immediately or go to the Accident and Emergency department at the nearest hospital.
Do not use candesartan if you are also taking aliskiren-containing medications and have kidney problems or diabetes.
Do not use candesartan if you have severe hepatic impairment and/or cholestasis (a condition where bile does not flow from the liver).
Do not use candesartan if you are pregnant. 
It may affect your baby if you take it during pregnancy.

<p><strong>Consumer Medicine Information</strong></p>
<h2>What is in this leaflet</h2>
<p>This leaflet answers some common questions about Cadivast.</p>
<p>It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>All medicines have benefits and risks. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking Cadivast against the benefits expected for you.</p>
<p><strong>If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keep this leaflet with your medicine.</strong> You may need to read it again.</p>
<h2>What Cadivast is used for</h2>
<p>Cadivast is used to treat:</p>
<ul>
<li>high blood pressure and high cholesterol (fat in the blood).</li>
<li>angina (a certain type of chest pain).</li>
<li>people who have high blood pressure and coronary heart disease (CHD) or who are at risk of CHD (for example, if they have diabetes, a history of stroke, or small blood vessel disease). In these people, Caduet is used to help reduce the risk of having a heart attack or stroke.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cadivast contains a combination of two medicines. One is amlodipine and the other is atorvastatin.</p>
<p>Amlodipine belongs to a group of medicines called calcium channel blockers. They work by relaxing your blood vessels, making it easier for your heart to pump blood around the body and help increase the supply of blood and oxygen to your heart. Calcium channel blockers do not change the amount of calcium in your blood or bones.</p>
<p>Atorvastatin belongs to a group of medicines called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. It works by reducing the amount of cholesterol made by the liver. It reduces the 'bad' cholesterol and can raise the 'good' cholesterol. Atorvastatin also helps to protect you from a heart attack or stroke.</p>
<p>Cadivast may be used alone, or in combination with other medicines, to treat your condition.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you.</strong></p>
<p>Your doctor may have prescribed it for another reason.</p>

Consumer Medicine Information
What is in this leaflet
This leaflet answers some common questions about Cadivast.
It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.
All medicines have benefits and risks. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking Cadivast against the benefits expected for you.
If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

What Cadivast is used for
Cadivast is used to treat:

high blood pressure and high cholesterol (fat in the blood).
angina (a certain type of chest pain).
people who have high blood pressure and coronary heart disease (CHD) or who are at risk of CHD (for example, if they have diabetes, a history of stroke, or small blood vessel disease). In these people, Caduet is used to help reduce the risk of having a heart attack or stroke.

Cadivast contains a combination of two medicines. One is amlodipine and the other is atorvastatin.
Amlodipine belongs to a group of medicines called calcium channel blockers. They work by relaxing your blood vessels, making it easier for your heart to pump blood around the body and help increase the supply of blood and oxygen to your heart. Calcium channel blockers do not change the amount of calcium in your blood or bones.
Atorvastatin belongs to a group of medicines called HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. It works by reducing the amount of cholesterol made by the liver. It reduces the 'bad' cholesterol and can raise the 'good' cholesterol. Atorvastatin also helps to protect you from a heart attack or stroke.
Cadivast may be used alone, or in combination with other medicines, to treat your condition.

<p>In treating rheumatoid arthritis, hydroxychloroquine may slow down the substances which harm the joints.</p>
<h3><em>Systemic Lupus Erythematous (SLE)</em></h3>
<p>SLE is a disease in which a person's normal immunity is upset. The body produces an excess of blood proteins called antibodies and these antibodies may cause problems in any organ of the body.</p>

<h3><em>Discoid Lupus Erythematous (DLE)</em></h3>
<p>DLE is similar to SLE except it only affects the skin and is characterized by a scaling, red rash.</p>
<h3><em>Malaria (treatment and control of symptoms)</em></h3>
<p>Malaria is an infectious disease caused by the presence of parasites in red blood cells.</p>
<p>The disease is characterized by chills, fever and sweats.</p>

<p>Make sure you have enough to last over weekends and holidays.</p>
<h3><em>If you forget to take it</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>If you are being given hydroxychloroquine for rheumatoid arthritis or SLE or DLE, do not take a double dose to make up for the dose missed. Just continue with the appropriate dose on the next day.</strong></li>
<li><strong>If you are being given hydroxychloroquine for suppression or treatment of malaria, you should take your tablets as soon as you remember, and go back to taking it as you would normally.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have trouble remembering when to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints.</p>
<h3><em>If you take too much (overdose)</em></h3>
<p><strong>If you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much of this medicine, immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (Tel: 13 11 26 in Australia) for advice. Alternatively, go to the Accident and Emergency department at your nearest hospital.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. You may need urgent medical attention.</strong></p>
<p>If you take too much hydroxychloroquine, you may experience headaches, drowsiness, visual disturbances or fits.</p>
<p>These symptoms may occur within 30 minutes of overdose.</p>
<h2>While you are taking this medicine</h2>
<p>Your doctor will need to perform the following tests during treatment with hydroxychloroquine:</p>
<p><strong>Eye Tests</strong> <br/>
Your doctor will need to perform some eye tests every few months to check that your eyesight is not changing.</p>
<p><strong>In extremely rare cases, hydroxychloroquine has been associated with blindness. This can be avoided by having regular eye tests.</strong></p>
<p>It is recommended you wear sunglasses when out in the sun.</p>
<p><strong>Blood Reactions</strong> <br/>
Your doctor will need to perform occasional blood tests to check for any blood reactions.</p>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>Tell any other doctors, dentists, and pharmacists who are treating you that you are taking hydroxychloroquine.</li>
<li>Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant.</li>
<li>If you are about to have any blood tests, tell your doctor that you are taking this medicine.</li>
<li>Go to your doctor regularly for a check-up.<br/>
Your doctor may occasionally do tests to make sure the medicine is working and to prevent side effects.</li>
<li>Tell your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms including:<br/>
- weakness<br/>
- trembling or shaking<br/>
- sweating<br/>
- light-headedness<br/>
- headache<br/>
- dizziness<br/>
- lack of concentration<br/>
- tearfulness or crying<br/>
- irritability<br/>
- hunger<br/>
- numbness around the lips and fingers.<br/>
These symptoms may be associated with hypoglycaemia.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Treating hypoglycaemia</strong> <br/>
If you experience any of the symptoms of hypoglycaemia, you need to raise your blood glucose urgently. You can do this by taking one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>5-7 jelly beans</li>
<li>3 teaspoons of sugar or honey</li>
<li>1/2 can of ordinary (non-diet) soft drink</li>
<li>2-3 concentrated glucose tablets</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless you are within 10 to 15 minutes of your next meal or snack, follow up with extra carbohydrates e.g. plain biscuits, fruit or milk - when over the initial symptoms.</p>
<p>Taking this extra carbohydrate will prevent a second drop in your blood glucose level.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure you, your friends, family and work colleagues can recognise the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and know how to treat them.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<ul>
<li>Do not give this medicine to anyone else, even if their symptoms seem similar to yours.</li>
<li>Do not take your medicine to treat any other complaints unless your doctor or pharmacist tells you to.</li>
<li>Do not stop taking your medicine, or change the dosage, without checking with your doctor.</li>
</ul>
<h3><em>Things to be careful of</em></h3>
<p>Be careful while driving or operating machinery until you know how hydroxychloroquine affects you.</p>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine may cause problems with the eyesight of some people. Make sure you know how you react to hydroxychloroquine before you drive a car, operate machinery, or do anything else that could be dangerous with blurred vision.</p>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine may cause hypoglycaemia, which can impair your ability to drive or operate machinery. Make sure you are aware of the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and avoid dangerous activities until your blood sugar returns to normal (see 'Treating hypoglycaemia' under 'Things you must do').</p>
<h2>Possible side effects</h2>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking hydroxychloroquine.</strong></p>
<p>All medicines may have some unwanted side effects. Sometimes they are serious, but most of the time, they are not. Your doctor has weighed the risks of using this medicine against the benefits they expect it will have for you.</p>
<p>Hydroxychloroquine helps most people with rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, DLE, treatment of malaria and the control of malaria symptoms, but it may have unwanted side effects in a few people.</p>

digoxin - a medicine used to treat heart disease
medicines to treat diabetes
medicines used to suppress the immune system such as cyclosporin
antiarrythmic drugs such as amiodarone, which control heart rhythm
other drugs to treat malaria

These medicines may be affected by hydroxychloroquine or may affect how well it works. You may need different amounts of your medicines, or you may need to take different medicines.
Your doctor and pharmacist can tell you if you are taking any of these medicines.
Other interactions not listed above may also occur.
How to take this medicine
Follow all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist carefully.
They may be different to the information in this leaflet.
If you do not understand any written instructions, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.
How much to take
Your doctor or pharmacist will tell you how many tablets you will need to take. This depends on your condition and whether or not you are taking any other medicines.
The dosage will depend on why you are being treated with hydroxychloroquine.
The usual doses are:
Rheumatoid arthritis
Adults 
2-3 tablets daily. Your doctor may later reduce this to 1-2 tablets daily.
SLE and DLE
Adults 
2-4 tablets daily. Your doctor may later reduce this to 1-2 tablets daily.
Control of Malaria Symptoms
Adults 
2 tablets once a week. The tablets should be taken on exactly the same day of each week.
For example, if your first dose is taken on a Monday, then each weekly dose should be taken on a Monday.
Treatment of Malaria
Adults 
The starting dose is 4 tablets. Take another 2 tablets six to eight hours later and 2 further tablets on each of the next two days.
Always follow the instructions given to you by your doctor.
Dosages for children are calculated according to the child's body weight. Your doctor will work out the correct dose for children.
Hydroxychloroquine should not be used in children for long periods.
Your doctor may ask you to take a different dose. You should follow the instructions on the label.
If you are unsure what dose to take ask your doctor.
How to take it
Swallow tablets whole with a little water or other liquid.
When to take it
It is best to take hydroxychloroquine at meal times.
How long to take it for
Continue taking your medicine for as long as your doctor tells you.
Make sure you have enough to last over weekends and holidays.
If you forget to take it

If you are being given hydroxychloroquine for rheumatoid arthritis or SLE or DLE, do not take a double dose to make up for the dose missed. Just continue with the appropriate dose on the next day.
If you are being given hydroxychloroquine for suppression or treatment of malaria, you should take your tablets as soon as you remember, and go back to taking it as you would normally.

If you have trouble remembering when to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints.
If you take too much (overdose)
If you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much of this medicine, immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (Tel: 13 11 26 in Australia) for advice. Alternatively, go to the Accident and Emergency department at your nearest hospital.
Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. You may need urgent medical attention.
If you take too much hydroxychloroquine, you may experience headaches, drowsiness, visual disturbances or fits.
These symptoms may occur within 30 minutes of overdose.
While you are taking this medicine
Your doctor will need to perform the following tests during treatment with hydroxychloroquine:
Eye Tests 
Your doctor will need to perform some eye tests every few months to check that your eyesight is not changing.
In extremely rare cases, hydroxychloroquine has been associated with blindness. This can be avoided by having regular eye tests.
It is recommended you wear sunglasses when out in the sun.
Blood Reactions 
Your doctor will need to perform occasional blood tests to check for any blood reactions.
Things you must do

Tell any other doctors, dentists, and pharmacists who are treating you that you are taking hydroxychloroquine.
Tell your doctor immediately if you become pregnant.
If you are about to have any blood tests, tell your doctor that you are taking this medicine.
Go to your doctor regularly for a check-up.
Your doctor may occasionally do tests to make sure the medicine is working and to prevent side effects.
Tell your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms including:
- weakness
- trembling or shaking
- sweating
- light-headedness
- headache
- dizziness
- lack of concentration
- tearfulness or crying
- irritability
- hunger
- numbness around the lips and fingers.
These symptoms may be associated with hypoglycaemia.

Treating hypoglycaemia 
If you experience any of the symptoms of hypoglycaemia, you need to raise your blood glucose urgently. You can do this by taking one of the following:

5-7 jelly beans
3 teaspoons of sugar or honey
1/2 can of ordinary (non-diet) soft drink
2-3 concentrated glucose tablets

Unless you are within 10 to 15 minutes of your next meal or snack, follow up with extra carbohydrates e.g. plain biscuits, fruit or milk - when over the initial symptoms.
Taking this extra carbohydrate will prevent a second drop in your blood glucose level.
Make sure you, your friends, family and work colleagues can recognise the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and know how to treat them.
Things you must not do

Do not give this medicine to anyone else, even if their symptoms seem similar to yours.
Do not take your medicine to treat any other complaints unless your doctor or pharmacist tells you to.
Do not stop taking your medicine, or change the dosage, without checking with your doctor.

Things to be careful of
Be careful while driving or operating machinery until you know how hydroxychloroquine affects you.
Hydroxychloroquine may cause problems with the eyesight of some people. Make sure you know how you react to hydroxychloroquine before you drive a car, operate machinery, or do anything else that could be dangerous with blurred vision.
Hydroxychloroquine may cause hypoglycaemia, which can impair your ability to drive or operate machinery. Make sure you are aware of the symptoms of hypoglycaemia and avoid dangerous activities until your blood sugar returns to normal (see 'Treating hypoglycaemia' under 'Things you must do').
Possible side effects
Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking hydroxychloroquine.
All medicines may have some unwanted side effects. Sometimes they are serious, but most of the time, they are not. Your doctor has weighed the risks of using this medicine against the benefits they expect it will have for you.
Hydroxychloroquine helps most people with rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, DLE, treatment of malaria and the control of malaria symptoms, but it may have unwanted side effects in a few people.
You may need medical treatment if you get some of the side effects.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.
Following is a list of possible side effects. Do not be alarmed by this list. You may not experience any of them.
Tell your doctor if you notice any of the following and they worry you:
Stomach problems such as:

Nausea
Vomiting
Diarrhoea
Abdominal cramps

Other problems such as:

Loss of appetite
Muscle weakness
Dizziness
Ringing in the ears
Headache
Nervousness
Skin rash and itching
Hair loss

If you already have psoriasis, you are more likely to experience skin reactions than other people when taking hydroxychloroquine.
Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you notice any of the following:

Visual disturbances
Any hearing loss
Frequent fevers, severe chills, bruising, sore throat or mouth ulcers (these may be signs of blood reactions)
More severe symptoms of hypoglycaemia, including:
- disorientation
- seizures, fits or convulsions
- loss of consciousness
Suicidal behaviour
Movement problems, such uncontrolled movements, stiffness or tremors
Wide spread rash with blisters, with or without fever, which can indicate a severe drug induced allergic reaction. It can involve blood changes and internal organs.

These are serious side effects. You may need medical attention.
Serious side effects are rare.
Other side effects not listed above may occur in some patients.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice anything that is making you feel unwell.
Storage and disposal
Storage
Keep your medicine in its original packaging until it is time to take it. If you take your medicine out of its original packaging it may not keep well.
Keep your medicine in a cool dry place where the temperature will stay below 25°C. Do not store your medicine, or any other medicine, in the bathroom or near a sink. Do not leave it on a window sill or in the car. Heat, sunlight and dampness can destroy some medicines.
Keep it where children cannot reach it.
Children are particularly sensitive to the unwanted effects of hydroxychloroquine.
A locked cupboard at least one-and-a-half metres above the ground is a good place to store medicines.
Disposal
If your doctor tells you to stop taking this medicine or it has passed its expiry date your pharmacist can dispose of the remaining medicine safely.

<h2>What is in this leaflet</h2>
<p>This leaflet answers some common questions about COSDOR. It does not contain all the available information.</p>
<p>It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you using COSDOR against the benefits they expect it will have for you.</p>

<p><strong>Keep this leaflet with the medicine.</strong> You may need to read it again.</p>
<h2>What COSDOR is used for</h2>
<p>COSDOR is used to lower raised pressure in the eye and to treat glaucoma. Glaucoma is a condition in which the pressure of fluid in the eye may be high. However, some people with glaucoma may have normal eye pressure. Also, some people with raised eye pressure may not have glaucoma.</p>
<p>Glaucoma is usually caused by a build-up of the fluid which flows through the eye. This build up occurs because the fluid drains out of your eye more slowly than it is being pumped in. Since new fluid continues to enter the eye, joining the fluid already there, the pressure continues to rise. This raised pressure may damage the back of the eye resulting in gradual loss of sight. Damage can progress so slowly that the person is not aware of this gradual loss of sight. Sometimes even normal eye pressure is associated with damage to the back of the eye.</p>
<p>There are usually no symptoms of glaucoma. The only way of knowing that you have glaucoma is to have your eye pressure, optic nerve and visual field checked by an eye specialist or optometrist. If glaucoma is not treated it can lead to serious problems. You may have no symptoms but eventually glaucoma can lead to total blindness. In fact, untreated glaucoma is one of the most common causes of blindness.</p>
<p>Although COSDOR helps control your glaucoma it does not cure it.</p>
<p>For more information about glaucoma, contact Glaucoma Australia Inc., PO Box 420, Crows Nest 1585, telephone 02 9906 6640.</p>
<p>COSDOR contains two active ingredients, dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate. Both of these active ingredients lower pressure in the eye by reducing the production of fluid, but they do this in different ways.</p>

<li>quinidine, a medicine used to treat irregular heart beats</li>
<li>medicines to treat diabetes</li>
<li>tablets used to treat glaucoma</li>
<li>large amounts of aspirin or salicylates</li>
<li>medicines to treat depression</li>
</ul>
<p>These medicines may be affected by COSDOR, or may affect how well it works. You may need different amounts of your medicines, or you may need to take different medicines.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist has more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while using COSDOR.</p>
<h2>How to use COSDOR</h2>
<h3><em>How much to use</em></h3>
<p>Your doctor will tell you how many drops you need to use each day.</p>
<p><strong>Use COSDOR only when prescribed by your doctor.</strong></p>
<p>The usual dose for adults is one drop of COSDOR twice a day, in either one or both eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Follow all directions given to you by your doctor carefully.</strong> They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.</p>
<p><strong>Use COSDOR every day, at about the same time each day, unless your doctor tells you otherwise.</strong> Using your eye drops at the same time each day will have the best effect on your eye pressure. It will also help you remember when to use the eye drops.</p>
<p><strong>After using COSDOR, wait at least 10 minutes before putting any other eye drops in your eye(s).</strong></p>
<h3><em>How to use it</em></h3>
<p>You may find it easier to put drops in your eye while you are sitting or lying down.</p>
<p><strong>Before opening the bottle for the first time, make sure the Safety Strip on the front of the bottle is not broken. If it is, do not use the bottle and return it to your pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p>You will notice a small space between the cap and the bottle- this is normal.</p>
<p><strong>If you are wearing soft contact lenses, remove them before putting the drops in your eye.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Wash your hands well with soap and water.</li>
<li>To open the bottle for the first time, tear off the Safety Strip to break the seal. Then hold the bottle upright, and turn the cap in the direction of the arrows until you can lift it off.</li>
<li>Place the cap upside down (arrows face down) on a flat surface. Do not touch the inside of the cap. This will help keep the inside of the cap clean and keep germs out of the eye drops.</li>
<li>Hold the bottle upside down in one hand, with your thumb or index finger over the ""finger push"" area.</li>
<li>Using your other hand, gently pull down your lower eyelid to form a pouch.</li>
<li>Tilt your head back and look up.</li>
<li>Put the tip of the bottle close to your lower eyelid. Do not let it touch your eye.</li>
<li>Release one drop into the pouch formed between your eye and eyelid by gently squeezing the bottle. Close your eye and keep it closed.</li>
<li>Do not blink or rub your eye.</li>
<li>While your eye is still closed, place your index finger against the inside corner of your eye and press against your nose for about two minutes. This will help to stop the medicine from draining through the tear duct to the nose and throat, from where it can be absorbed into other parts of your body. Ask your doctor for more specific instructions on this technique.</li>
<li>Replace the cap, sealing it tightly. Do not overtighten the cap.</li>
<li>Wash your hands again with soap and water to remove any residue.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Wait at least 15 minutes before replacing your contact lenses.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be careful not to touch the dropper tip against your eye, eyelid or anything else to avoid contaminating the eye drops.</strong> Contaminated eye drops may give you an eye infection.</p>
<p>You may feel a slight burning sensation in the eye after using the eye drops.</p>
<p><strong>If this persists, or is very uncomfortable, contact your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How long to use it</em></h3>
<p>COSDOR helps control your condition but does not cure it.</p>
<p>Therefore COSDOR must be used every day. Continue using COSDOR for as long as your doctor prescribes.</p>
<h3><em>If you forget to use it</em></h3>
<p><strong>If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and have your next dose when you are meant to. Otherwise, use the drops as soon as you remember, and then go back to using them as you</strong></p>
<p><strong>would normally.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are not sure whether to skip the dose, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not use double the amount to make up for the dose that you missed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have trouble remembering to use your eye drops, ask your pharmacist for some hints.</strong></p>
<h3><em>If you use too much (overdose)</em></h3>
<p><strong>If you think that you or anyone else may have swallowed any or all of the contents of a bottle of COSDOR, or used too many drops, immediately telephone your doctor or Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26) for advice, or go to accident or emergency at your nearest hospital. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.</strong></p>
<p>If COSDOR is accidentally swallowed, or if you use too many drops, you may feel light-headed or dizzy, you may faint, have a very slow pulse rate, or have wheezing or difficulty breathing.</p>
<h2>While you are using it</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Have your eye pressure checked when your eye specialist says, to make sure COSDOR is working.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you develop an eye infection, receive an eye injury, or have eye surgery tell your doctor.</strong></p>
<p>Your doctor may tell you to use a new bottle of COSDOR because of possible contamination of the old one, or may advise you to stop your treatment with COSDOR.</p>
<p><strong>If you become pregnant while using COSDOR, tell your doctor.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are about to be started on any new medicine, tell your doctor and pharmacist that you are using COSDOR.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not give COSDOR to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not stop using COSDOR without first talking to your doctor.</strong> If you stop using your eye drops, your eye pressure may rise again and damage to your eye may occur.</p>
<h3><em>Things to be careful of</em></h3>
<p><strong>Be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how COSDOR affects you.</strong> COSDOR generally does not cause any problems with your ability to drive a car or operate machinery. However, COSDOR may cause blurred vision or dizziness in some people. Make sure you know how you react to COSDOR or that your vision is clear before driving a car or operating machinery.</p>
<h2>Side effects</h2>

<h2>After using it</h2>
<h3><em>Storage</em></h3>
<p><strong>Keep your eye drops in a cool place where the temperature stays below 25°C.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not store it or any other medicine in the bathroom or near a sink.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not leave it in the car or on window sills.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not carry the eye drops in pockets of your clothes.</strong> Heat and dampness can destroy some medicines.</p>

<h3><em>Disposal</em></h3>
<p><strong>Write the date on the bottle when you open the eye drops and throw out any remaining solution after four weeks.</strong></p>
<p>Eye drops contain a preservative which helps prevent germs growing in the solution for the first four weeks after opening the bottle. After this time there is a greater risk that the drops may become contaminated and cause an eye infection. A new bottle should be opened.</p>
<p><strong>If your doctor tells you to stop using the eye drops or they have passed their expiry date, ask your pharmacist what to do with any remaining solution.</strong></p>

Consumer Medicine Information
What is in this leaflet
This leaflet answers some common questions about COSDOR. It does not contain all the available information.
It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.
All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you using COSDOR against the benefits they expect it will have for you.
If you have any concerns about using this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Keep this leaflet with the medicine. You may need to read it again.
What COSDOR is used for
COSDOR is used to lower raised pressure in the eye and to treat glaucoma. Glaucoma is a condition in which the pressure of fluid in the eye may be high. However, some people with glaucoma may have normal eye pressure. Also, some people with raised eye pressure may not have glaucoma.
Glaucoma is usually caused by a build-up of the fluid which flows through the eye. This build up occurs because the fluid drains out of your eye more slowly than it is being pumped in. Since new fluid continues to enter the eye, joining the fluid already there, the pressure continues to rise. This raised pressure may damage the back of the eye resulting in gradual loss of sight. Damage can progress so slowly that the person is not aware of this gradual loss of sight. Sometimes even normal eye pressure is associated with damage to the back of the eye.
There are usually no symptoms of glaucoma. The only way of knowing that you have glaucoma is to have your eye pressure, optic nerve and visual field checked by an eye specialist or optometrist. If glaucoma is not treated it can lead to serious problems. You may have no symptoms but eventually glaucoma can lead to total blindness. In fact, untreated glaucoma is one of the most common causes of blindness.
Although COSDOR helps control your glaucoma it does not cure it.
For more information about glaucoma, contact Glaucoma Australia Inc., PO Box 420, Crows Nest 1585, telephone 02 9906 6640.
COSDOR contains two active ingredients, dorzolamide hydrochloride and timolol maleate. Both of these active ingredients lower pressure in the eye by reducing the production of fluid, but they do this in different ways.
Dorzolamide hydrochloride belongs to a family of medicines called carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Timolol maleate belongs to a family of medicines called beta-blockers.
COSDOR is not addictive.

How to use COSDOR
How much to use
Your doctor will tell you how many drops you need to use each day.
Use COSDOR only when prescribed by your doctor.
The usual dose for adults is one drop of COSDOR twice a day, in either one or both eyes.
Follow all directions given to you by your doctor carefully. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.
Use COSDOR every day, at about the same time each day, unless your doctor tells you otherwise. Using your eye drops at the same time each day will have the best effect on your eye pressure. It will also help you remember when to use the eye drops.
After using COSDOR, wait at least 10 minutes before putting any other eye drops in your eye(s).
How to use it
You may find it easier to put drops in your eye while you are sitting or lying down.
Before opening the bottle for the first time, make sure the Safety Strip on the front of the bottle is not broken. If it is, do not use the bottle and return it to your pharmacist.
You will notice a small space between the cap and the bottle- this is normal.
If you are wearing soft contact lenses, remove them before putting the drops in your eye.

Wash your hands well with soap and water.
To open the bottle for the first time, tear off the Safety Strip to break the seal. Then hold the bottle upright, and turn the cap in the direction of the arrows until you can lift it off.
Place the cap upside down (arrows face down) on a flat surface. Do not touch the inside of the cap. This will help keep the inside of the cap clean and keep germs out of the eye drops.
Hold the bottle upside down in one hand, with your thumb or index finger over the ""finger push"" area.
Using your other hand, gently pull down your lower eyelid to form a pouch.
Tilt your head back and look up.
Put the tip of the bottle close to your lower eyelid. Do not let it touch your eye.
Release one drop into the pouch formed between your eye and eyelid by gently squeezing the bottle. Close your eye and keep it closed.
Do not blink or rub your eye.
While your eye is still closed, place your index finger against the inside corner of your eye and press against your nose for about two minutes. This will help to stop the medicine from draining through the tear duct to the nose and throat, from where it can be absorbed into other parts of your body. Ask your doctor for more specific instructions on this technique.
Replace the cap, sealing it tightly. Do not overtighten the cap.
Wash your hands again with soap and water to remove any residue.

Wait at least 15 minutes before replacing your contact lenses.
Be careful not to touch the dropper tip against your eye, eyelid or anything else to avoid contaminating the eye drops. Contaminated eye drops may give you an eye infection.
You may feel a slight burning sensation in the eye after using the eye drops.
If this persists, or is very uncomfortable, contact your doctor or pharmacist.
How long to use it
COSDOR helps control your condition but does not cure it.
Therefore COSDOR must be used every day. Continue using COSDOR for as long as your doctor prescribes.
If you forget to use it
If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and have your next dose when you are meant to. Otherwise, use the drops as soon as you remember, and then go back to using them as you
would normally.
If you are not sure whether to skip the dose, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
Do not use double the amount to make up for the dose that you missed.
If you have trouble remembering to use your eye drops, ask your pharmacist for some hints.
If you use too much (overdose)
If you think that you or anyone else may have swallowed any or all of the contents of a bottle of COSDOR, or used too many drops, immediately telephone your doctor or Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26) for advice, or go to accident or emergency at your nearest hospital. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.
If COSDOR is accidentally swallowed, or if you use too many drops, you may feel light-headed or dizzy, you may faint, have a very slow pulse rate, or have wheezing or difficulty breathing.

Do not leave the cap off the bottle for any length of time to avoid contaminating the eye drops.
Disposal
Write the date on the bottle when you open the eye drops and throw out any remaining solution after four weeks.
Eye drops contain a preservative which helps prevent germs growing in the solution for the first four weeks after opening the bottle. After this time there is a greater risk that the drops may become contaminated and cause an eye infection. A new bottle should be opened.
If your doctor tells you to stop using the eye drops or they have passed their expiry date, ask your pharmacist what to do with any remaining solution.

<p><strong>Consumer Medicine Information</strong></p>
<h2>What is in this leaflet</h2>
<p>This leaflet answers some common questions about SEVIKAR HCT. It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking SEVIKAR HCT against the benefits they expect it will have for you.</p>
<p><strong>If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keep this leaflet with the medicine.</strong> You may need to read it again.</p>
<h2>What SEVIKAR HCT is used for</h2>
<p>SEVIKAR HCT is used to treat high blood pressure which is sometimes called hypertension.</p>
<p>Everyone has blood pressure. This pressure helps push blood all around your body. Your blood pressure changes at different times of the day, depending on how busy or worried you are. You have hypertension (high blood pressure) when your blood pressure stays higher than is needed, even when you are calm and relaxed.</p>
<p>There are usually no symptoms of hypertension. The only way of knowing that you have hypertension is to have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. If high blood pressure is not treated it can lead to serious health problems, including stroke, heart disease and kidney failure.</p>
<h3><em>How SEVIKAR HCT works</em></h3>
<p>SEVIKAR HCT contains olmesartan medoxomil, which belongs to a group of medicines known as angiotensin-II receptor antagonists. Angiotensin-II is a substance produced in the body which causes blood vessels to tighten. SEVIKAR HCT blocks the action of angiotensin-II and therefore relaxes your blood vessels. This helps lower your blood pressure.</p>
<p>SEVIKAR HCT also contains amlodipine besilate, a calcium channel blocker. This reduces the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. This also helps to lower blood pressure as it relaxes the blood vessels and increases the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart.</p>
<p>SEVIKAR HCT also contains hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic which reduces the amount of fluid in the body. This also helps to lower blood pressure.</p>
<p>Your doctor may have prescribed SEVIKAR HCT for another reason. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why SEVIKAR HCT has been prescribed for you.</p>
<p>This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription.</p>
<p>The safety and effectiveness of SEVIKAR HCT in children and teenagers under the age of 18 years have not been established.</p>
<p>SEVIKAR HCT is not addictive.</p>

<h3><em>Use in children</em></h3>
<p>The safety and effectiveness of SEVIKAR HCT in children have not been established.</p>
<h2>How to take SEVIKAR HCT</h2>
<p><strong>Follow all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist carefully.</strong> They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.</p>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will tell you which SEVIKAR HCT tablet you will need to take each day. This depends on your condition and whether or not you are taking any other medicines.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not understand the instructions on the box, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How much to take</em></h3>
<p>The dose of SEVIKAR HCT is one tablet to be taken once a day.</p>
<h3><em>How to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Swallow SEVIKAR HCT whole with a full glass of water.</strong></p>
<p>Do not chew the tablets.</p>
<h3><em>When to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Take SEVIKAR HCT at about the same time each day, with or without food.</strong> Taking your tablets at the same time each day will have the best effect. It will also help you remember when to take the tablets. It does not matter whether you take it with or without food.</p>
<h3><em>How long to take it</em></h3>
<p>SEVIKAR HCT helps control your condition, but does not cure it. Therefore you must take SEVIKAR HCT every day. Continue taking your medicine for as long as your doctor tells you.</p>
<h3><em>If you forget to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Otherwise, take it as soon as you remember and then go back to taking your medicine as you would normally.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed.</strong> This may increase the chance of you getting an unwanted side effect.</p>
<p><strong>If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints.</strong></p>
<h3><em>If you take too much (overdose)</em></h3>
<p><strong>Immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26) or go to Accident and Emergency at the nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much SEVIKAR HCT. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keep telephone numbers for these places handy.</strong></p>
<p>If you take too much SEVIKAR HCT, you may feel light-headed, dizzy or you may faint. You may also have nausea, drowsiness, muscle spasm and a fast heartbeat.</p>
<h2>While you are using SEVIKAR HCT</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p><strong>If you are about to be started on any new medicine, tell your doctor, dentist or pharmacist that you are taking SEVIKAR HCT.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Make sure you drink enough water during exercise and hot weather when you are taking SEVIKAR HCT, especially if you sweat a lot.</strong> If you do not drink enough water while taking SEVIKAR HCT, you may feel light-headed or sick. This is because your blood pressure is dropping suddenly. If you continue to feel unwell, tell your doctor.</p>
<p><strong>If you have excess vomiting and/or diarrhoea while taking SEVIKAR HCT, tell your doctor.</strong> You may lose too much water and salt and your blood pressure may drop too much. You may also have dry mouth, weakness, drowsiness, confusion, muscle pain or cramps and seizures. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>If you feel light-headed or dizzy after taking your first dose of SEVIKAR HCT, or when your dose is increased, tell your doctor immediately.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you plan to have surgery that needs a general anaesthetic, tell your doctor or dentist that you are taking SEVIKAR HCT.</strong> Your blood pressure may drop suddenly.</p>
<p><strong>If you become pregnant while taking SEVIKAR HCT, tell your doctor immediately.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you are about to have any blood tests, tell your doctor that you are taking SEVIKAR HCT.</strong> SEVIKAR HCT may interfere with the results of some tests.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if photosensitivity reaction occurs during your treatment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor immediately in case of acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Have your blood pressure checked when your doctor says, to make sure SEVIKAR HCT is working.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Go to your doctor regularly for a check-up. Your doctor may occasionally do a blood test to check your potassium levels and see how your kidneys are working.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not give SEVIKAR HCT to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not take SEVIKAR HCT to treat any other complaints unless your doctor or pharmacist tells you to.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not stop taking SEVIKAR HCT, or lower the dosage, without checking with your doctor.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things to be careful of</em></h3>
<p><strong>If you feel light-headed, dizzy or faint when getting out of bed or standing up, get up slowly.</strong> Standing up slowly, especially when you get up from bed or chairs, will help your body get used to the change in position and blood pressure. If this problem continues or gets worse, talk to your doctor.</p>
<p><strong>Be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how SEVIKAR HCT affects you.</strong> As with other medicines in this class, SEVIKAR HCT may cause dizziness, light-headedness or tiredness in some people. Make sure you know how you react to SEVIKAR HCT before you drive a car, operate machinery, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or light-headed. If this occurs do not drive. If you drink alcohol, dizziness or light-headedness may be worse.</p>
<h3><em>Things that would be helpful for your blood pressure</em></h3>
<p>Some self-help measures suggested below may help your condition. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about these measures and for more information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alcohol - your doctor may advise you to limit your alcohol intake.</li>
<li>Weight - your doctor may suggest losing some weight to help lower your blood pressure and help lessen the amount of work your heart has to do. Some people may need a dietician's help to lose weight.</li>
<li>Diet - eat a healthy diet which includes plenty of fresh vegetables, fruit, bread (preferably wholegrain), cereals and fish. Also eat less sugar and fat (especially saturated fat) which includes sausages, fatty meats, full cream dairy products, biscuits, cakes, pastries, chocolates, chips and coconut. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats from olive oil, canola oil, avocado and nuts are beneficial in small quantities.</li>
<li>Salt - your doctor may advise you to watch the amount of salt in your diet. To reduce your salt intake you should avoid using salt in cooking or at the table and avoid cooked or processed foods containing high sodium (salt) levels.</li>
<li>Exercise - regular exercise, maintained over the long term, helps to reduce blood pressure and helps get the heart fitter. Regular exercise also improves your blood cholesterol levels, helps reduce your weight and stress levels, and improves your sleep, mood and ability to concentrate. However, it is important not to overdo it. Walking is good exercise, but try to find a route that is reasonably flat. Before starting any exercise, ask your doctor about the best kind of programme for you.</li>
<li>Smoking - your doctor may advise you to stop smoking or at least cut down. There are enormous benefits to be gained from giving up smoking. There are many professionals, organisations and strategies to help you quit. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for further information and advice.</li>
</ul>

How to take SEVIKAR HCT
Follow all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist carefully. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.
Your doctor or pharmacist will tell you which SEVIKAR HCT tablet you will need to take each day. This depends on your condition and whether or not you are taking any other medicines.
If you do not understand the instructions on the box, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.
How much to take
The dose of SEVIKAR HCT is one tablet to be taken once a day.
How to take it
Swallow SEVIKAR HCT whole with a full glass of water.
Do not chew the tablets.
When to take it
Take SEVIKAR HCT at about the same time each day, with or without food. Taking your tablets at the same time each day will have the best effect. It will also help you remember when to take the tablets. It does not matter whether you take it with or without food.
How long to take it
SEVIKAR HCT helps control your condition, but does not cure it. Therefore you must take SEVIKAR HCT every day. Continue taking your medicine for as long as your doctor tells you.
If you forget to take it
If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to.
Otherwise, take it as soon as you remember and then go back to taking your medicine as you would normally.
Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed. This may increase the chance of you getting an unwanted side effect.
If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints.
If you take too much (overdose)
Immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26) or go to Accident and Emergency at the nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much SEVIKAR HCT. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.
Keep telephone numbers for these places handy.
If you take too much SEVIKAR HCT, you may feel light-headed, dizzy or you may faint. You may also have nausea, drowsiness, muscle spasm and a fast heartbeat.
While you are using SEVIKAR HCT
Things you must do
If you are about to be started on any new medicine, tell your doctor, dentist or pharmacist that you are taking SEVIKAR HCT.
Make sure you drink enough water during exercise and hot weather when you are taking SEVIKAR HCT, especially if you sweat a lot. If you do not drink enough water while taking SEVIKAR HCT, you may feel light-headed or sick. This is because your blood pressure is dropping suddenly. If you continue to feel unwell, tell your doctor.
If you have excess vomiting and/or diarrhoea while taking SEVIKAR HCT, tell your doctor. You may lose too much water and salt and your blood pressure may drop too much. You may also have dry mouth, weakness, drowsiness, confusion, muscle pain or cramps and seizures. Tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of these symptoms.
If you feel light-headed or dizzy after taking your first dose of SEVIKAR HCT, or when your dose is increased, tell your doctor immediately.
If you plan to have surgery that needs a general anaesthetic, tell your doctor or dentist that you are taking SEVIKAR HCT. Your blood pressure may drop suddenly.
If you become pregnant while taking SEVIKAR HCT, tell your doctor immediately.
If you are about to have any blood tests, tell your doctor that you are taking SEVIKAR HCT. SEVIKAR HCT may interfere with the results of some tests.
Tell your doctor if photosensitivity reaction occurs during your treatment.
Tell your doctor immediately in case of acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain.
Have your blood pressure checked when your doctor says, to make sure SEVIKAR HCT is working.
Go to your doctor regularly for a check-up. Your doctor may occasionally do a blood test to check your potassium levels and see how your kidneys are working.
Things you must not do
Do not give SEVIKAR HCT to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.
Do not take SEVIKAR HCT to treat any other complaints unless your doctor or pharmacist tells you to.
Do not stop taking SEVIKAR HCT, or lower the dosage, without checking with your doctor.
Things to be careful of
If you feel light-headed, dizzy or faint when getting out of bed or standing up, get up slowly. Standing up slowly, especially when you get up from bed or chairs, will help your body get used to the change in position and blood pressure. If this problem continues or gets worse, talk to your doctor.
Be careful driving or operating machinery until you know how SEVIKAR HCT affects you. As with other medicines in this class, SEVIKAR HCT may cause dizziness, light-headedness or tiredness in some people. Make sure you know how you react to SEVIKAR HCT before you drive a car, operate machinery, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or light-headed. If this occurs do not drive. If you drink alcohol, dizziness or light-headedness may be worse.
Things that would be helpful for your blood pressure
Some self-help measures suggested below may help your condition. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about these measures and for more information.

Alcohol - your doctor may advise you to limit your alcohol intake.
Weight - your doctor may suggest losing some weight to help lower your blood pressure and help lessen the amount of work your heart has to do. Some people may need a dietician's help to lose weight.
Diet - eat a healthy diet which includes plenty of fresh vegetables, fruit, bread (preferably wholegrain), cereals and fish. Also eat less sugar and fat (especially saturated fat) which includes sausages, fatty meats, full cream dairy products, biscuits, cakes, pastries, chocolates, chips and coconut. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats from olive oil, canola oil, avocado and nuts are beneficial in small quantities.
Salt - your doctor may advise you to watch the amount of salt in your diet. To reduce your salt intake you should avoid using salt in cooking or at the table and avoid cooked or processed foods containing high sodium (salt) levels.
Exercise - regular exercise, maintained over the long term, helps to reduce blood pressure and helps get the heart fitter. Regular exercise also improves your blood cholesterol levels, helps reduce your weight and stress levels, and improves your sleep, mood and ability to concentrate. However, it is important not to overdo it. Walking is good exercise, but try to find a route that is reasonably flat. Before starting any exercise, ask your doctor about the best kind of programme for you.
Smoking - your doctor may advise you to stop smoking or at least cut down. There are enormous benefits to be gained from giving up smoking. There are many professionals, organisations and strategies to help you quit. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for further information and advice.

Side effects
Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking SEVIKAR HCT.
SEVIKAR HCT helps most people with high blood pressure, but it may have unwanted side effects in a few people. All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical treatment if you get some of the side effects.
If you are over 65 years of age you may have an increased chance of getting side effects.

These may be serious side effects. You may need medical attention. Serious side effects are rare.
If any of the following happen, stop taking SEVIKAR HCT and either tell your doctor immediately or go to Accident and Emergency at your nearest hospital:

swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat which may cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing
chest pain

These are very serious side effects. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation. These side effects are very rare.

After using SEVIKAR HCT
Storage
Keep your tablets in the box until it is time to take them. If you take the tablets out of the box they will not keep well.
Keep your tablets in a cool dry place where the temperature stays below 25°C.
Do not store SEVIKAR HCT or any other medicine in the bathroom or near a sink.
Do not leave it on a windowsill or in the car on hot days. Heat and dampness can destroy some medicines.
Keep it where children cannot reach it. A locked cupboard at least one-and-a-half metres above the ground is a good place to store medicines.
Disposal
If your doctor tells you to stop taking SEVIKAR HCT or the tablets have passed their expiry date, ask your pharmacist what to do with any that are left over.

<p><strong>Consumer Medicine Information</strong></p>
<h2>What is in this leaflet</h2>
<p>This leaflet answers some common questions about PENTASA.</p>
<p>It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.</p>
<p>Please read this leaflet before you start using PENTASA.</p>
<p>All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you using PENTASA against the benefits they expect it will have for you.</p>
<p><strong>If you have any concerns about using this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p>Keep this leaflet with the medicine. You may need to read it again.</p>
<h2>What PENTASA is used for</h2>
<p>This medicine is used to treat Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, diseases associated with inflammation, ulcers and sores in the bowel causing bleeding, stomach pain, and diarrhoea.</p>
<p>The active ingredient in PENTASA is mesalazine. It is an anti-inflammatory agent, similar to aspirin, and is thought to work by reducing inflammation in the bowel.</p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you.</strong> Your doctor may have prescribed it for another reason.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that PENTASA is addictive.</p>
<p>It is available only with a doctor's prescription.</p>
<p>It is not expected to affect your ability to drive a car or operate machinery.</p>
<h2>Before you take PENTASA</h2>
<h3><em>When you must not take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not take PENTASA if you have an allergy to:</strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>shortness of breath, wheezing or difficulty breathing</li>

<li>rash, itching or hives on the skin.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do not take PENTASA if you have a severe kidney or liver problem.</strong></p>

<li>a kidney or liver problem</li>
<li>a bleeding disorder</li>

The underlying condition itself (inflammatory bowel disease) may increase risks for the pregnancy outcome.</p>
<p><strong>If you have not told your doctor about any of the above, tell him/her before you start using PENTASA.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Taking other medicines</em></h3>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using any other medicines, including any that you get without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.</strong></p>

Consumer Medicine Information
What is in this leaflet
This leaflet answers some common questions about PENTASA.
It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist.
Please read this leaflet before you start using PENTASA.
All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you using PENTASA against the benefits they expect it will have for you.
If you have any concerns about using this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
Keep this leaflet with the medicine. You may need to read it again.
What PENTASA is used for
This medicine is used to treat Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, diseases associated with inflammation, ulcers and sores in the bowel causing bleeding, stomach pain, and diarrhoea.
The active ingredient in PENTASA is mesalazine. It is an anti-inflammatory agent, similar to aspirin, and is thought to work by reducing inflammation in the bowel.
Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you. Your doctor may have prescribed it for another reason.
There is no evidence that PENTASA is addictive.
It is available only with a doctor's prescription.
It is not expected to affect your ability to drive a car or operate machinery.
Before you take PENTASA
When you must not take it
Do not take PENTASA if you have an allergy to:

any medicine containing mesalazine or aspirin-like medicines
any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet.

Some of the symptoms of an allergic reaction may include:

shortness of breath, wheezing or difficulty breathing
swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body
rash, itching or hives on the skin.

Do not take PENTASA if you have a severe kidney or liver problem.
Do not take PENTASA after the expiry date printed on the pack or if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering. If it has expired or is damaged, return it to your pharmacist for disposal.
Do not give PENTASA to a child 12 years old or under. The safety and effectiveness of PENTASA in this age group have not been established.
Before you start to take it
Tell your doctor if you have allergies to any other medicines, foods, preservatives or dyes.
Tell your doctor if you have or have had any of the following medical conditions:

a known allergy to PENTASA, sulfasalazine or aspirin-like medicines, or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet
a kidney or liver problem
a bleeding disorder
a history of asthma.

Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or are breast-feeding. Your doctor can discuss with you the risks and benefits involved. PENTASA should be used with caution during pregnancy and breast-feeding and only if the potential benefits outweigh the possible risks in the opinion of the doctor. The underlying condition itself (inflammatory bowel disease) may increase risks for the pregnancy outcome.
If you have not told your doctor about any of the above, tell him/her before you start using PENTASA.
Taking other medicines
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are using any other medicines, including any that you get without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.
There is no information available on interactions between PENTASA and other medicines. However, mesalazine belongs to a group of medicines called salicylates that may interfere with the following types of medicines:

anti-coagulants, used to thin blood or stop blood clots (e.g. warfarin)
glucocorticoids, used to treat inflammation, swelling or allergies (e.g. prednisolone)
sulphonylureas, used to lower blood sugar and treat diabetes (e.g. glibenclamide, glipizide)
methotrexate, used to treat some kinds of cancers and arthritis
probenicid or sulfinpyrazone, used to treat gout
spirinolactone or frusemide, used to increase the amount of urine produced, and to lower blood pressure
rifampicin, used to treat tuberculosis
azathioprine, used to suppress the immune system
mercaptopurine and thioguanine, used to treat leukaemia.

Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about taking any of these medicines.
Your doctor and pharmacist have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while taking this medicine.

Follow all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist carefully. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.

How to take Flecainide Sandoz
Read the label carefully and follow all directions given to you by your doctor and pharmacist. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet.
If you do not understand the instructions on the pack, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.
How much to take
Your doctor will tell you how much Flecainide Sandoz you should take. The usual starting dose of Flecainide Sandoz is 50 to 100 mg every 12 hours. Your doctor may gradually increase this dose. The usual maximum dose is 300 mg per day, however some patients may need up to 400 mg per day.
Never change the dose yourself. It is very important to follow your doctor's instructions exactly.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure of the correct dose for you. They will tell you exactly how much to take. This depends on your condition and whether or not you are taking any other medicines.
If you take the wrong dose, Flecainide Sandoz may not work as well and your problem may not improve.
When to take it
Flecainide Sandoz is usually taken twice a day.
Swallow the tablets with a full glass of water, before or after meals.
How long to take it
Continue taking the medicine for as long as your doctor tells you to.
Do not stop taking it unless your doctor tells you to. It is very important to follow your doctor's instructions exactly. Stopping this medicine suddenly may make your condition worse.
If you are unsure whether you should stop taking Flecainide Sandoz, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
If you forget to take it
If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take the next dose when you are meant to.
Do not try to make up for missed doses by taking more than one dose at a time. This may increase the chance of getting an unwanted side effect. If you miss two or more doses, please talk to your doctor.
If there is still a long time to go before your next dose, take it as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking it as you would normally.
If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for hints.

<p>It is used to treat:</p>
<ul>
<li>high blood pressure (essential hypertension) or,</li>

<h3><em>How it works</em></h3>
<p>This medicine belongs to a group of medicines called beta-blockers.</p>
<p>High Blood Pressure (Hypertension):</p>
<p>Nebivolol can be used to treat high blood pressure. It works by blocking the transmission of messages to the beta receptors in the heart which slows down the activity of the heart. It also relaxes the blood vessels and reduces the resistance that the heart has to pump against. The blood pressure lowering effects occur after 1 to 2 weeks, although it may take up to 4 weeks for the full effect to occur.</p>
<p>Chronic Heart Failure:</p>
<p>Nebivolol can also be used to treat chronic heart failure. It slows down the heart rate and makes it beat more regularly.</p>
<p>It also reduces the pressure the heart has to pump against and therefore reduces the amount of work that the heart has to do.</p>

<h3><em>Before you start to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>You are allergic to:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>any other medicines</li>
<li>any other substances, such as foods, preservatives or dyes.</li>

</ol>
<p><strong>If you have not told your doctor about any of the above, tell them before you start taking amoxycillin.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Taking other medicines</em></h3>

</ul>
<p>These medicines may be affected by amoxycillin, or may affect how well it works. You may need different amounts of your medicine, or you may need to take different medicines.</p>
<p>Your doctor and pharmacist will advise you. They will tell you if you are taking any of these medicines. They may also have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while taking amoxycillin.</p>
<h2>How to take this medicine</h2>
<p><strong>Follow all directions from your doctor or pharmacist carefully.</strong> They may be different to the information in this leaflet.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not understand any written instructions, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.</strong></p>
<h3><em>How much to take</em></h3>
<p>Your doctor or pharmacist will tell you how many capsules you will need to take. This depends on your condition and whether or not you are taking any other medicines.</p>
<p>The usual adult dose is one capsule (250 mg or 500 mg) three times a day.</p>
<p>For some infections 3 grams of amoxycillin (i.e. six 500 mg capsules) can be taken by adults at one time.</p>
<h3><em>How to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Swallow amoxycillin capsules whole with a glass of fluid.</strong></p>
<h3><em>When to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>Take it at about the same time each day.</strong> Taking your medicine at the same time each day will have the best effect. It will also help you remember when to take it.</p>
<p><strong>Space the doses as evenly as possible throughout the day.</strong> For example, if you are taking amoxycillin three times a day, take a dose about every eight hours.</p>
<p>Amoxycillin can be taken with or without food. The effects of amoxycillin are not changed by food.</p>
<h3><em>How long to take it for</em></h3>
<p><strong>Continue taking amoxycillin until you finish the pack or until your doctor says so.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not stop taking your capsules because you are feeling better.</strong> If you do not complete the full course prescribed by your doctor, the infection may not clear completely or your symptoms may return.</p>
<p>Make sure you have enough to last over weekends and holidays.</p>
<h3><em>If you forget to take it</em></h3>
<p><strong>If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to.</strong> Otherwise, take it as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking your medicine as you would normally.</p>
<p><strong>Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed.</strong> This may increase the chance of you getting an unwanted side effect.</p>
<p><strong>If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints.</strong></p>
<h3><em>If you take too much (overdose)</em></h3>
<p><strong>Immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (Tel: 13 11 26 for Australia) or go to the Accident and Emergency Department at the nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much amoxycillin.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning.</strong> You may need urgent medical attention.</p>
<p>If you take too much amoxycillin, you may feel sick or get diarrhoea.</p>
<h2>While you are taking this medicine</h2>
<h3><em>Things you must do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor if:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The symptoms of your infection do not improve within a few days, or if they become worse.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You develop itching with swelling or skin rash or difficulty breathing. Stop taking this medicine and contact your doctor immediately.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You get severe diarrhoea. Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately. Do this even if it occurs several weeks after you stopped taking amoxycillin.</strong> <br/>
Diarrhoea may mean that you have a serious condition affecting your bowel. You may need urgent medical care.<br/>
<strong>Do not take any anti-diarrhoea medicine without first checking with your doctor.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You get a sore white mouth or tongue while taking or soon after stopping amoxycillin, or if you get vaginal itching or discharge.</strong> <br/>
This may mean you have a fungal infection called thrush. Sometimes the use of amoxycillin allows fungi to grow and the above symptoms to occur. Amoxycillin does not work against fungi.</li>
<li><strong>You are about to have any blood tests.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You become pregnant.</strong></li>
<li><strong>You are about to start taking any other new medicine.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Tell any other doctors, dentists, and pharmacists who are treating you that you are taking amoxycillin.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Keep any appointments with your doctor.</strong> Your doctor may want to do tests to make sure the medicine is working and to prevent side effects.</p>
<h3><em>Things you must not do</em></h3>
<p><strong>Do not stop taking your medicine because you are feeling better, unless advised by your doctor. </strong> If you do not complete the full course prescribed by your doctor, all of the bacteria causing your infection may not be killed. These bacteria may continue to grow and multiply so that your infection may not clear completely or it may return and be more difficult to treat.</p>
<p><strong>Do not give this medicine to anyone else, even if their symptoms seem similar to yours.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not take your medicine to treat any other complaints unless your doctor or pharmacist tells you to.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do not stop taking your medicine, or change the dosage, without checking with your doctor.</strong></p>
<h3><em>Things to be careful of</em></h3>
<p><strong>Be careful while driving or operating machinery until you know how amoxycillin affects you.</strong> Amoxycillin generally does not cause any problems with your ability to drive a car or operate machinery. However, as with many other medicines, amoxycillin may cause dizziness, drowsiness or tiredness in some people.</p>
<h2>Possible side effects</h2>
<p>All medicines may have some unwanted side effects. Sometimes they are serious, but most of the time, they are not. Your doctor has weighed the risks of using this medicine against the benefits they expect it will have for you.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking amoxycillin.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.</strong></p>
<p>Following is a list of possible side effects. Do not be alarmed by this list. You may not experience any of them.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any of the following and they worry you:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>oral thrush - white, furry, sore tongue and mouth</li>
<li>vaginal thrush - sore and itchy vagina and/or discharge</li>

<ul>
<li>allergic reaction including fainting, swelling of limbs, face, lips, mouth or throat which may cause difficulty swallowing or breathing.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a very serious side effect. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation.</p>
<p><strong>Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following side effects, even if they occur several weeks after you have stopped taking amoxycillin:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>severe abdominal cramps or stomach cramps</li>
<li>watery and severe diarrhoea, which may also be bloody</li>
<li>fever, in combination with one or both of the above.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are rare but serious side effects. You may have a serious condition affecting your bowel. Therefore, you may need urgent medical attention. However, this side effect is rare.</p>
<p><strong>Do not take any anti-diarrhoea medicine without first checking with your doctor.</strong></p>

Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you. Your doctor may have prescribed amoxycillin for another reason.
This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription.
There is no evidence that this medicine is addictive.
This medicine is not expected to affect your ability to drive a car or operate machinery, but make sure you know how it affects you before driving.
Use in children
Amoxycillin Suspension is a more suitable form of amoxycillin than capsules, for giving to children.
Before you take this medicine
When you must not take it
Do not take this medicine if you have had an allergic reaction to:

amoxycillin
other penicillins or cephalosporins
any of the ingredients listed near the end of this leaflet.

Symptoms of an allergic reaction may include shortness of breath, wheezing or difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body, muscle pain or tenderness or joint pain or rash, itching or hives on the skin.
Do not take this medicine after the expiry date (EXP) printed on the pack. If you take this medicine after the expiry date has passed, it may not work as well.
Do not take this medicine if the packaging is torn or shows signs of tampering or if it does not look quite right. If it has expired or is damaged, return it to your pharmacist for disposal.
If you are not sure whether you should start taking amoxycillin, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.
Before you start to take it
Tell your doctor if:

You are allergic to:


any other medicines
any other substances, such as foods, preservatives or dyes.


You have ever had an allergic reaction (such as a rash) to any antibiotics in the past.
You have or have had any medical conditions, especially the following:


glandular fever (mononucleosis)
blood disorders such as leukaemia
liver or kidney problems.


You are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or breast-feed. 
Your doctor can discuss with you the risks and benefits involved. Amoxycillin may be used during pregnancy. It can pass to your baby through breast milk.
Your urine has to be tested for sugar levels while taking amoxycillin. 
Amoxycillin will produce false positive results when some of these tests are used. Your doctor will help you to identify the correct test.

If you have not told your doctor about any of the above, tell them before you start taking amoxycillin.
Taking other medicines
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, including any that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop.
Some medicines and amoxycillin may interfere with each other. These include:

medicines used to treat gout (e.g. probenecid or allopurinol)
other antibiotics (e.g. tetracyclines)
the contraceptive pill. As with other antibiotics you may need to use extra birth control methods (e.g. condoms).

These medicines may be affected by amoxycillin, or may affect how well it works. You may need different amounts of your medicine, or you may need to take different medicines.
Your doctor and pharmacist will advise you. They will tell you if you are taking any of these medicines. They may also have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while taking amoxycillin.
How to take this medicine
Follow all directions from your doctor or pharmacist carefully. They may be different to the information in this leaflet.
If you do not understand any written instructions, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help.
How much to take
Your doctor or pharmacist will tell you how many capsules you will need to take. This depends on your condition and whether or not you are taking any other medicines.
The usual adult dose is one capsule (250 mg or 500 mg) three times a day.
For some infections 3 grams of amoxycillin (i.e. six 500 mg capsules) can be taken by adults at one time.
How to take it
Swallow amoxycillin capsules whole with a glass of fluid.
When to take it
Take it at about the same time each day. Taking your medicine at the same time each day will have the best effect. It will also help you remember when to take it.
Space the doses as evenly as possible throughout the day. For example, if you are taking amoxycillin three times a day, take a dose about every eight hours.
Amoxycillin can be taken with or without food. The effects of amoxycillin are not changed by food.
How long to take it for
Continue taking amoxycillin until you finish the pack or until your doctor says so.
Do not stop taking your capsules because you are feeling better. If you do not complete the full course prescribed by your doctor, the infection may not clear completely or your symptoms may return.
Make sure you have enough to last over weekends and holidays.
If you forget to take it
If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to. Otherwise, take it as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking your medicine as you would normally.
Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed. This may increase the chance of you getting an unwanted side effect.
If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints.
If you take too much (overdose)
Immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (Tel: 13 11 26 for Australia) or go to the Accident and Emergency Department at the nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much amoxycillin.
Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. You may need urgent medical attention.
If you take too much amoxycillin, you may feel sick or get diarrhoea.
While you are taking this medicine
Things you must do
Tell your doctor if:

The symptoms of your infection do not improve within a few days, or if they become worse.
You develop itching with swelling or skin rash or difficulty breathing. Stop taking this medicine and contact your doctor immediately.
You get severe diarrhoea. Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse immediately. Do this even if it occurs several weeks after you stopped taking amoxycillin. 
Diarrhoea may mean that you have a serious condition affecting your bowel. You may need urgent medical care.
Do not take any anti-diarrhoea medicine without first checking with your doctor.
You get a sore white mouth or tongue while taking or soon after stopping amoxycillin, or if you get vaginal itching or discharge. 
This may mean you have a fungal infection called thrush. Sometimes the use of amoxycillin allows fungi to grow and the above symptoms to occur. Amoxycillin does not work against fungi.
You are about to have any blood tests.
You become pregnant.
You are about to start taking any other new medicine.

Tell any other doctors, dentists, and pharmacists who are treating you that you are taking amoxycillin.
Keep any appointments with your doctor. Your doctor may want to do tests to make sure the medicine is working and to prevent side effects.
Things you must not do
Do not stop taking your medicine because you are feeling better, unless advised by your doctor.  If you do not complete the full course prescribed by your doctor, all of the bacteria causing your infection may not be killed. These bacteria may continue to grow and multiply so that your infection may not clear completely or it may return and be more difficult to treat.
Do not give this medicine to anyone else, even if their symptoms seem similar to yours.
Do not take your medicine to treat any other complaints unless your doctor or pharmacist tells you to.
Do not stop taking your medicine, or change the dosage, without checking with your doctor.
Things to be careful of
Be careful while driving or operating machinery until you know how amoxycillin affects you. Amoxycillin generally does not cause any problems with your ability to drive a car or operate machinery. However, as with many other medicines, amoxycillin may cause dizziness, drowsiness or tiredness in some people.
Possible side effects
All medicines may have some unwanted side effects. Sometimes they are serious, but most of the time, they are not. Your doctor has weighed the risks of using this medicine against the benefits they expect it will have for you.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking amoxycillin.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have.
Following is a list of possible side effects. Do not be alarmed by this list. You may not experience any of them.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any of the following and they worry you:

oral thrush - white, furry, sore tongue and mouth
vaginal thrush - sore and itchy vagina and/or discharge
diarrhoea
nausea (feeling sick), indigestion or vomiting
black or brown furry patches on the tongue (rare).

The above list includes the more common side effects. Mostly, these are mild.
Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you notice any of the following:

itching or any type of skin rash
unusual bleeding or bruising
yellowing of the skin or eyes
dark urine or pale stools
difficulty or pain on passing urine
severe diarrhoea
feeling hyperactive or having trouble concentrating.

These may be serious side effects. You may need medical attention. Most of these side effects are rare.
If any of the following happen, stop taking your medicine and either tell your doctor immediately or go to Accident and Emergency at your nearest hospital:

allergic reaction including fainting, swelling of limbs, face, lips, mouth or throat which may cause difficulty swallowing or breathing.

This is a very serious side effect. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation.
Tell your doctor immediately if you notice any of the following side effects, even if they occur several weeks after you have stopped taking amoxycillin:

severe abdominal cramps or stomach cramps
watery and severe diarrhoea, which may also be bloody
fever, in combination with one or both of the above.

These are rare but serious side effects. You may have a serious condition affecting your bowel. Therefore, you may need urgent medical attention. However, this side effect is rare.
Do not take any anti-diarrhoea medicine without first checking with your doctor.
Other side effects not listed above may occur in some patients.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice anything that is making you feel unwell.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you don't understand anything in this list.
Storage and disposal
Storage
Keep amoxycillin in its original packaging until it is time to take it. If you take the capsules out of their original packaging they may not keep well.
Keep your medicine in a cool dry place where the temperature will stay below 25°C. Protect it from moisture.
Do not store your medicine, or any other medicine, in the bathroom or near a sink.
Do not leave it on a window sill or in the car on hot days. Heat and dampness can destroy some medicines.
Keep it where children cannot reach it. A locked cupboard at least one-and-a-half metres above the ground is a good place to store medicines.
Disposal
If your doctor or pharmacist tells you to stop taking this medicine or it has passed its expiry date, ask your pharmacist what to do with any medicine that is left over.
Where to go for further information
Pharmaceutical companies are not in a position to give people an individual diagnosis or medical advice. Your doctor or pharmacist is the best person to give you advice on the treatment of your condition.
