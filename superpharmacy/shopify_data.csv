<div><h2>Airomir Salbutamol (100mcg) Autohaler 200 Doses</h2>
<h3>Description:</h3><p>Airomir Autohaler has a medicine called salbutamol sulfate. The amount of medicine in each puff of Airomir Autohaler is the same as 100 micrograms of salbutamol. It is designed so the medicine can be inhaled (breathed in) into the lungs to treat asthma and other conditions where breathing is difficult. Salbutamol sulfate opens up the airways to your lungs, thereby relieving wheezing and the feeling of tightness in your chest, and helps you breathe more easily. This medicine may also help prevent wheezing and chest tightness in some situations that cause narrowing of the airways to your lungs, like exercise</p>
<p>Size - at least 200 puffs.</p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3><p>Salbutamol sulfate</p>
<h3>Usage Directions:</h3><p>If your Airomir Autohaler is new or has not been used for two weeks or more, you must test fire it by releasing four puffs into the air away from your face.</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the mouthpiece cover by unclipping it from the back. Check that the mouthpiece is clean before use. Hold the autohaler unit upright between your thumb and index finger and shake well.</li>
<li>Hold the autohaler unit upright. Push the lever up so that it stays up. Keep holding the autohaler unit upright, making sure that your hand is not blocking the air vent at the bottom.</li>
<li>Breathe out as far as you comfortably can and immediately close your lips around the mouthpiece.</li>
<li>Breathe in slowly and deeply through the mouthpiece. Do not stop breathing in when you hear the click and whoosh and feel the puff in your mouth. It is important that you keep breathing in after the puff is released</li>
<li>Hold your breath for 10 seconds, then breathe out slowly.</li>
<li>After each puff return the lever to the down position whilst holding the autohaler unit upright. If your doctor has prescribed more than one puff, repeat steps 2 to 6. Replace the mouthpiece cover after use.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember to push the lever up before each puff, and gently back down afterwards, always holding the autohaler upright. This prepares it for your next dose. The lever should be left down between treatments and the mouthpiece cover replaced.</p>
<p>Do not use the dose release slide to take your medicine. Your Airomir Autohaler will automatically release a dose when you begin to breathe in from the mouthpiece.</p>
<h3>Storage:</h3><p>Store below 30°C.</p>
